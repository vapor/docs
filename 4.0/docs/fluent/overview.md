# Fluent

Fluent is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) framework for Swift. It takes advantage of Swift's strong type system to provide an easy-to-use interface for your database. Using Fluent centers around the creation of model types which represent data structures in your database. These models are then used to perform create, read, update, and delete operations instead of writing raw queries.

## Configuration

When creating a project using `vapor new`, answer "yes" to including Fluent and choose which database driver you want to use. This will automatically add the dependencies to your new project as well as example configuration code.

### Existing Project

If you have an existing project that you want to add Fluent to, you will need to add two dependencies to your [package](../spm.md):

- [vapor/fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent)@4.0.0
- One (or more) Fluent driver(s) of your choice

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/fluent.git", from: "4.0.0-beta"),
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/fluent-<db>-driver.git", from: <version>),
```

```swift
.target(name: "App", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "Fluent", package: "fluent"),
    .product(name: "Fluent<db>Driver", package: "fluent-<db>-driver"),
    .product(name: "Vapor", package: "vapor"),
]),
```

Once the packages are added as dependencies, you can configure your databases using `app.databases` in `configure.swift`.

```swift
import Fluent
import Fluent<db>Driver

app.databases.use(<db config>, as: <identifier>)
```

Each of the Fluent drivers below has more specific instructions for configuration.

### Drivers

Fluent currently has three officially supported drivers. You can search GitHub for the tag [`fluent-driver`](https://github.com/topics/fluent-database) for a full list of official and third-party Fluent database drivers.

#### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an open source, standards compliant SQL database. It is easily configurable on most cloud hosting providers. This is Fluent's **recommended** database driver.

To use PostgreSQL, add the following dependencies to your package.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/fluent-postgres-driver.git", from: "2.0.0-beta")
```

```swift
.product(name: "FluentPostgresDriver", package: "fluent-postgres-driver")
```

Once the dependencies are added, configure the database's credentials with Fluent using `app.databases.use` in `configure.swift`.

```swift
import Fluent
import FluentPostgresDriver

app.databases.use(.postgres(hostname: "localhost", username: "vapor", password: "vapor", database: "vapor"), as: .psql)
```

You can also parse the credentials from a database connection string.

```swift
try app.databases.use(.postgres(url: "<connection string>"), as: .psql)
```

#### SQLite

SQLite is an open source, embedded SQL database. Its simplistic nature makes it a great candiate for prototyping and testing.

To use SQLite, add the following dependencies to your package.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/fluent-sqlite-driver.git", from: "4.0.0-beta")
```

```swift
.product(name: "FluentSQLiteDriver", package: "fluent-sqlite-driver")
```

Once the dependencies are added, configure the database with Fluent using `app.databases.use` in `configure.swift`.

```swift
import Fluent
import FluentSQLiteDriver

app.databases.use(.sqlite(.file("db.sqlite")), as: .sqlite)
```

You can also configure SQLite to store the database ephemerally in memory.

```swift
app.databases.use(.sqlite(.memory), as: .sqlite)
```

If you use an in-memory database, make sure to set Fluent to migrate automatically using `--auto-migrate` or run `app.autoMigrate()` after adding migrations.

```swift
app.migrations.add(CreateTodo())
try app.autoMigrate().wait()
```

#### MySQL

MySQL is a popular open source SQL database. It is available on many cloud hosting providers. This driver also supports MariaDB.

To use MySQL, add the following dependencies to your package.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/fluent-mysql-driver.git", from: "4.0.0-beta")
```

```swift
.product(name: "FluentMySQLDriver", package: "fluent-mysql-driver")
```

Once the dependencies are added, configure the database's credentials with Fluent using `app.databases.use` in `configure.swift`.

```swift
import Fluent
import FluentMySQLDriver

app.databases.use(.mysql(hostname: "localhost", username: "vapor", password: "vapor", database: "vapor"), as: .mysql)
```

You can also parse the credentials from a database connection string.

```swift
try app.databases.use(.mysql(url: "<connection string>"), as: .mysql)
```

#### MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular schemaless NoSQL database designed for programmers. The driver supports all cloud hosting providers and self-hosted installations from version 3.4 and up.

To use MongoDB, add the following dependencies to your package.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/fluent-mongo-driver.git", from: "1.0.0-rc"),
```

```swift
.product(name: "FluentMongoDriver", package: "fluent-mongo-driver")
```

Once the dependencies are added, configure the database's credentials with Fluent using `app.databases.use` in `configure.swift`.

To connect, pass a connection string in the standard MongoDB [connection URI format](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/reference/connection-string/index.html).

```swift
import Fluent
import FluentMongoDriver

try app.databases.use(.mongo(connectionString: "<connection string>"), as: .mongo)
```

## Models

Models represent fixed data structures in your database, like tables or collections. Models have one or more fields that store codable values. All models also have a unique identifier. Property wrappers are used to denote identifiers and fields as well as more complex mappings mentioned later. Take a look at the following model which represents a galaxy.

```swift
final class Galaxy: Model {
    // Name of the table or collection.
    static let schema = "galaxies"

    // Unique identifier for this Galaxy.
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?

    // The Galaxy's name.
    @Field(key: "name")
    var name: String

    // Creates a new, empty Galaxy.
    init() { }

    // Creates a new Galaxy with all properties set.
    init(id: UUID? = nil, name: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

To create a new model, create a new class conforming to `Model`.

!!! tip
    It's recommended to mark model classes `final` to improve performance and simplify conformance requirements.

The `Model` protocol's first requirement is the static string `schema`.

```swift
static let schema = "galaxies"
```

This property tells Fluent which table or collection the model corresponds to. This can be a table that already exists in the database or one that you will create with a [migration](#migration). The schema is usually `snake_case` and plural.

### Identifier

The next requirement is an identifier field named `id`.

```swift
@ID(key: .id)
var id: UUID?
```

This field must use the `@ID` property wrapper. Fluent recommends using `UUID` and the special `.id` field key since this is compatible with all of Fluent's drivers.

If you want to use a custom ID key or type, use the `@ID(custom:)` overload.

### Fields

After the identifier is added, you can add however many fields you'd like to store additional information. In this example, the only additional field is the galaxy's name.

```swift
@Field(key: "name")
var name: String
```

For simple fields, the `@Field` property wrapper is used. Like `@ID`, the `key` parameter specifies the field's name in the database. This is especially useful for cases where database field naming convention may be different than in Swift, e.g., using `snake_case` instead of `camelCase`.

Next, all models require an empty init. This allows Fluent to create new instances of the model.

```swift
init() { }
```

Finally, you can add a convenience init for your model that sets all of its properties.

```swift
init(id: UUID? = nil, name: String) {
    self.id = id
    self.name = name
}
```

Using convenience inits is especially helpful if you add new properties to your model as you can get compile-time errors if the init method changes.

## Migrations

If your database uses pre-defined schemas, like SQL databases, you will need a migration to prepare the database for your model. Migrations are also useful for seeding databases with data. To create a migration, define a new type conforming to the `Migration` protocol. Take a look at the following migration for the previously defined `Galaxy` model.

```swift
struct CreateGalaxy: Migration {
    // Prepares the database for storing Galaxy models.
    func prepare(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("galaxies")
            .id()
            .field("name", .string)
            .create()
    }

    // Optionally reverts the changes made in the prepare method.
    func revert(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("galaxies").delete()
    }
}
```

The `prepare` method is used for preparing the database to store `Galaxy` models.

### Schema

In this method, `database.schema(_:)` is used to create a new `SchemaBuilder`. One or more `field`s are then added to the builder before calling `create()` to create the schema.

Each field added to the builder has a name, type, and optional constraints.

```swift
field(<name>, <type>, <optional constraints>)
```

There is a convenience `id()` method for adding `@ID` properties using Fluent's recommended defaults.

Reverting the migration undoes any changes made in the prepare method. In this case, that means deleting the Galaxy's schema.

Once the migration is defined, you must tell Fluent about it by adding it to `app.migrations` in `configure.swift`.

```swift
app.migrations.add(CreateGalaxy())
```

### Migrate

To run migrations, call `vapor run migrate` from the command line or add `migrate` as an argument to Xcode's Run scheme.


```
$ vapor run migrate
Migrate Command: Prepare
The following migration(s) will be prepared:
+ CreateGalaxy on default
Would you like to continue?
y/n> y
Migration successful
```

## Querying

Now that you've successfully created a model and migrated your database, you're ready to make your first query.

### All

Take a look at the following route which will return an array of all the galaxies in the database.

```swift
app.get("galaxies") { req in
    Galaxy.query(on: req.db).all()
}
```

In order to return a Galaxy directly in a route closure, add conformance to `Content`.

```swift
final class Galaxy: Model, Content {
    ...
}
```

`Galaxy.query` is used to create a new query builder for the model. `req.db` is a reference to the default database for your application. Finally, `all()` returns all of the models stored in the database.

If you compile and run the project and request `GET /galaxies`, you should see an empty array returned. Let's add a route for creating a new galaxy.

### Create


Following RESTful convention, use the `POST /galaxies` endpoint for creating a new galaxy. Since models are codable, you can decode a galaxy directly from the request body.

```swift
app.post("galaxies") { req -> EventLoopFuture<Galaxy> in
    let galaxy = try req.content.decode(Galaxy.self)
    return galaxy.create(on: req.db)
        .map { galaxy }
}
```

!!! seealso
    See [Content &rarr; Overview](../content.md) for more information about decoding request bodies.

Once you have an instance of the model, calling `create(on:)` saves the model to the database. This returns an `EventLoopFuture<Void>` which signals that the save has completed. Once the save completes, return the newly created model using `map`.

Build and run the project and send the following request.

```http
POST /galaxies HTTP/1.1
content-length: 21
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "Milky Way"
}
```

You should get the created model back with an identifier as the response.

```json
{
    "id": ...,
    "name": "Milky Way"
}
```

Now, if you query `GET /galaxies` again, you should see the newly created galaxy returned in the array.


## Relations

What are galaxies without stars! Let's take a quick look at Fluent's powerful relational features by adding a one-to-many relation between `Galaxy` and a new `Star` model.

```swift
final class Star: Model, Content {
    // Name of the table or collection.
    static let schema = "stars"

    // Unique identifier for this Star.
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?

    // The Star's name.
    @Field(key: "name")
    var name: String

    // Reference to the Galaxy this Star is in.
    @Parent(key: "galaxy_id")
    var galaxy: Galaxy

    // Creates a new, empty Star.
    init() { }

    // Creates a new Star with all properties set.
    init(id: UUID? = nil, name: String, galaxyID: UUID) {
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.$galaxy.id = galaxyID
    }
}
```

### Parent

The new `Star` model is very similar to `Galaxy` except for a new field type: `@Parent`.

```swift
@Parent(key: "galaxy_id")
var galaxy: Galaxy
```

The parent property is a field that stores another model's identifier. The model holding the reference is called the "child" and the referenced model is called the "parent". This type of relation is also known as "one-to-many". The `key` parameter to the property specifies the field name that should be used to store the parent's key in the database.

In the init method, the parent identifier is set using `$galaxy`.

```swift
self.$galaxy.id = galaxyID
```

 By prefixing the parent property's name with `$`, you access the underlying property wrapper. This is required for getting access to the internal `@Field` that stores the actual identifier value.

!!! seealso
    Check out the Swift Evolution proposal for property wrappers for more information: [[SE-0258] Property Wrappers](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md)

Next, create a migration to prepare the database for handling `Star`.


```swift
struct CreateStar: Migration {
    // Prepares the database for storing Star models.
    func prepare(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("stars")
            .id()
            .field("name", .string)
            .field("galaxy_id", .uuid, .references("galaxies", "id"))
            .create()
    }

    // Optionally reverts the changes made in the prepare method.
    func revert(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("stars").delete()
    }
}
```

This is mostly the same as galaxy's migration except for the additional field to store the parent galaxy's identifier.

```swift
field("galaxy_id", .uuid, .references("galaxies", "id"))
```

This field specifies an optional constraint telling the database that the field's value references the field "id" in the "galaxies" schema. This is also known as a foreign key and helps ensure data integrity.

Once the migration is created, add it to `app.migrations` after the `CreateGalaxy` migration.

```swift
app.migrations.add(CreateGalaxy())
app.migrations.add(CreateStar())
```

Since migrations run in order, and `CreateStar` references the galaxies schema, ordering is important. Finally, [run the migrations](#migrate) to prepare the database.

Add a route for creating new stars.

```swift
app.post("stars") { req -> EventLoopFuture<Star> in
    let star = try req.content.decode(Star.self)
    return star.create(on: req.db)
        .map { star }
}
```

Create a new star referencing the previously created galaxy using the following HTTP request.

```http
POST /stars HTTP/1.1
content-length: 36
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "Sun",
    "galaxy": {
        "id": ...
    }
}
```

You should see the newly created star returned with a unique identifier.

```json
{
    "id": ...,
    "name": "Sun",
    "galaxy": {
        "id": ...
    }
}
```

### Children

Now let's take a look at how you can utilize Fluent's eager-loading feature to automatically return a galaxy's stars in the `GET /galaxies` route. Add the following property to the `Galaxy` model.

```swift
// All the Stars in this Galaxy.
@Children(for: \.$galaxy)
var stars: [Star]
```

The `@Children` property wrapper is the inverse of `@Parent`. It takes a key-path to the child's `@Parent` field as the `for` argument. Its value is an array of children since zero or more child models may exist. No changes to the galaxy's migration are needed since all the information needed for this relation is stored on `Star`.

### Eager Load

Now that the relation is complete, you can use the `with` method on the query builder to automatically fetch and serialize the galaxy-star relation.

```swift
app.get("galaxies") { req in
    Galaxy.query(on: req.db).with(\.$stars).all()
}
```

A key-path to the `@Children` relation is passed to `with` to tell Fluent to automatically load this relation in all of the resulting models. Build and run and send another request to `GET /galaxies`. You should now see the stars automatically included in the response.

```json
[
    {
        "id": ...,
        "name": "Milky Way",
        "stars": [
            {
                "id": ...,
                "name": "Sun",
                "galaxy": {
                    "id": ...
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```


### Siblings

The last type of relationship is many-to-many, or sibling relationship.  Create a `Tag` model with an `id` and `name` field that we'll use to tag stars with certain characteristics.  

```swift
final class Tag: Model, Content {
    // Name of the table or collection.
    static let schema: String = "tags"

    // Unique identifier for this Tag.
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?

    // The Tag's name.
    @Field(key: "name")
    var name: String

    // Creates a new, empty Tag.
    init() {}

    // Creates a new Tag with all properties set.
    init(id: UUID? = nil, name: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

A tag can have many stars and a star can have many tags making them siblings.  A sibling relationship between two models requires a third model (called a pivot) that holds the relationship data.  Each of these `StarTag` model objects will represent a single star-to-tag relationship holding the ids of a single `Star` and a single `Tag`:

```swift
final class StarTag: Model {
    // Name of the table or collection.
    static let schema: String = "star_tag"

    // Unique identifier for this pivot.
    @ID(key: .id)
    var id: UUID?

    // Reference to the Tag this pivot relates.
    @Parent(key: "tag_id")
    var tag: Tag

    // Reference to the Star this pivot relates.
    @Parent(key: "star_id")
    var star: Star

    // Creates a new, empty pivot.
    init() {}

    // Creates a new pivot with all properties set.
    init(tagID: UUID, starID: UUID) {
        self.$tag.id = tagID
        self.$star.id = starID
    }

}
```

Now let's update our new `Tag` model to add a `stars` property for all the stars that contain a tag:

```swift
@Siblings(through: StarTag.self, from: \.$tag, to: \.$star)
var stars: [Star]
```

The` @Siblings` property wrapper takes three arguments. The first argument is the pivot model that we created earlier, `StarTag`. The next two arguments are key paths to the pivot model's parent relations. The `from` key path is the pivot's parent relation to the current model, in this case `Tag`. The `to` key path is the pivot's parent relation to the related model, in this case `Star`. These three arguments together create a relation from the current model `Tag`, through the pivot `StarTag`, to the desired model `Star`. Now let's update our `Star` model with its siblings property which is the inverse of the one we just created:

```swift
@Siblings(through: StarTag.self, from: \.$star, to: \.$tag)
var tags: [Tag]
```

These siblings properties rely on `StarTag` for storage so we don't need to update the `Star` migration, but we do need to create migrations for the new `Tag` and `StarTag` models:

```swift
struct CreateTag: Migration {
    func prepare(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("tags")
            .id()
            .field("name", .string)
            .create()
    }

    func revert(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("tags").delete()
    }

}

struct CreateStarTag: Migration {
    func prepare(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("star_tag")
            .id()
            .field("star_id", .uuid, .required, .references("stars", "id"))
            .field("tag_id", .uuid, .required, .references("tags", "id"))
            .create()
    }

    func revert(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        database.schema("star_tag").delete()
    }
}
```

And then add the migrations in configure.swift:

```swift
app.migrations.add(CreateTag())
app.migrations.add(CreateStarTag())
```

Now we want to add tags to stars.  After creating a route to create a new tag, we need to create a route that will add a tag to an existing star.

```swift
app.post("star", ":starID", "tag", ":tagID") { req -> EventLoopFuture<HTTPStatus> in
    let star = Star.find(req.parameters.get("starID"), on: req.db)
        .unwrap(or: Abort(.notFound))
    let tag = Tag.find(req.parameters.get("tagID"), on: req.db)
        .unwrap(or: Abort(.notFound))
    return star.and(tag).flatMap { (star, tag) in
        star.$tags.attach(tag, on: req.db)
    }.transform(to: .ok)
}
```

This route includes parameter path components for the IDs of star and tag that we want to associate with one another.  If we want to create a relationship between a star with an ID of 1 and a tag with an ID of 2, we'd send a **POST** request to  `/star/1/tag/2` and we'd receive an HTTP response code in return.  First, we lookup the star and tag in the database to ensure these are valid IDs.  Then, we create the relationship by attaching the tag to the star's tags.  Since the star's `tags` property is a relationship to another model, we need to access it via it's `@Siblings` property wrapper by using the `$` operator.

Siblings aren't fetched by default so we need to update our get route for stars if we want include them when querying by inserting the `with` method:

```swift
app.get("stars") { req in
    Star.query(on: req.db).with(\.$tags).all()
}
```

## Lifecycle

To create hooks that respond to events on your `Model`, you can create middlewares for your model. Your middleware must conform to `ModelMiddleware`.

Here is an example of a simple middleware:

```swift
struct GalaxyMiddleware: ModelMiddleware {
    // Runs when a model is created
    func create(model: Galaxy, on db: Database, next: AnyModelResponder) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return next.create(model, on: db)
    }

    // Runs when a model is updated
    func update(model: Galaxy, on db: Database, next: AnyModelResponder) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return next.update(model, on: db)
    }

    // Runs when a model is soft deleted
    func softDelete(model: Galaxy, on db: Database, next: AnyModelResponder) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return next.softDelete(model, on: db)
    }

    // Runs when a soft deleted model is restored
    func restore(model: Galaxy, on db: Database, next: AnyModelResponder) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return next.restore(model , on: db)
    }

    // Runs when a model is deleted
    // If the "force" parameter is true, the model will be permanently deleted,
    // even when using soft delete timestamps.
    func delete(model: Galaxy, force: Bool, on db: Database, next: AnyModelResponder) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return next.delete(model, force: force, on: db)
    }
}
```

Each of these methods has a default implementation, so you only need to include the methods you require. You should return the corresponding method on the next `AnyModelResponder` so Fluent continues processing the event.

!!! Important
    The middleware will only respond to lifecycle events of the `Model` type provided in the functions. In the above example `GalaxyMiddleware` will respond to events on the Galaxy model.

Using these methods you can perform actions both before, and after the event completes.  Performing actions after the event completes can be done using using .flatMap() on the future returned from the next responder.  For example:

```swift
struct GalaxyMiddleware: ModelMiddleware {
    func create(model: Galaxy, on db: Database, next: AnyModelResponder) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {

        // The model can be altered here before it is created
        model.name = "<New Galaxy Name>"

        return next.create(model, on: db).flatMap {
            // Once the galaxy has been created, the code here will be executed
            print ("Galaxy \(model.name) was created")
        }
    }
}
```

Once you have created your middleware, you must register it with the `Application`'s database middleware configuration so Vapor will use it. In `configure.swift` add:

```swift
app.databases.middleware.use(GalaxyMiddleware(), on: .psql)
```

## Timestamps

Fluent provides the ability to track creation and update times on models by specifying `Timestamp` fields in your model. Fluent automatically sets the fields when necessary. You can add these like so:

```swift
@Timestamp(key: "created_at", on: .create)
var createdAt: Date?

@Timestamp(key: "updated_at", on: .update)
var updatedAt: Date?
```

!!! Info
    You can use any name/key for these fields. `created_at` / `updated_at`, are only for illustration purposes

Timestamps are added as fields in a migration using the `.datetime` data type.

```swift
database.schema(...)
    ...
    .field("created_at", .datetime)
    .field("updated_at", .datetime)
    .create()
```

### Soft Delete

Soft deletion marks an item as deleted in the database but doesn't actually remove it. This can be useful when you have data retention requirements, for example. In Fluent, it works by setting a deletion timestamp. By default, soft deleted items won't appear in queries and can be restored at any time.

Similar to created and deleted timestamps, to enable soft deletion in a model just set a deletion timestamp for `.delete`:

```swift
@Timestamp(key: "deleted_at", on: .delete)
var deletedAt: Date?
```

Calling `Model.delete(on:)` on a model that has a delete timestamp property will automatically soft delete it.

If you need to perform a query that includes the soft deleted items, you can use `withDeleted()` in your query.

```swift
// Get all galaxies including soft-deleted ones.
Galaxy.query(on: db).withDeleted().all()
```

You can restore a soft deleted model with `restore(on:)`:

```swift
// Restore galaxy
galaxy.restore(on: db)
```

To permanently delete an item with an on-delete timestamp, use the `force` parameter:

```swift
// Permanently delete
galaxy.delete(force: true, on: db)
```
