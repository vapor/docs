It is responsible for registering routes, starting the server, appending middleware, and more.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nNormally applications will only have one Droplet. However, for advanced use cases, it is possible to create more than one.\n\n\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nAs you have probably already seen, the only thing required to create an instance of \nDroplet\n is to import Vapor.\n\n\nimport\n \nVapor\n\n\n\nlet\n \ndrop\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nDroplet\n()\n\n\n\n// your magic here\n\n\n\ntry\n \ndrop\n.\nrun\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation of the \nDroplet\n normally happens in the \nmain.swift\n file. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, most of the documentations sample code uses just the \nmain.swift\n file. You can read more about packages and modules in the Swift Package Manager \nconceptual overview\n.\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\nThe \nenvironment\n is accessible via the config of the droplet.\nIt contains the current environment your application is running in. Usually development, testing, or production.\n\n\nif\n \ndrop\n.\nconfig\n.\nenvironment\n \n==\n \n.\nproduction\n \n{\n\n    \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment affects \nConfig\n and \nLogging\n. The environment is \ndevelopment\n by default. To change it, pass the \n--env=\n flag as an argument.\n\n\nvapor run serve --env\n=\nproduction\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are in Xcode, you can pass arguments through the scheme editor.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nDebug logs can reduce the number of requests your application can handle per second. Enable production mode to silence non-critical logs.\n\n\n\n\nConfig Directory\n\n\nThe \nworkDir\n property contains a path to the current working directory of the application. Vapor uses this property to find the folders related to your project, such as \nResources\n, \nPublic\n, and \nConfig\n.\n\n\nprint\n(\ndrop\n.\nconfig\n.\nworkDir\n)\n \n// /var/www/my-project/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVapor automatically determines the working directory in most situations. However, you may need to manually set it for advanced use cases.\n\n\nYou can override the working directory through the \nDroplet\n's initializer, or by passing the \n--workdir\n argument.\n\n\nvapor run serve --workdir\n=\n/var/www/my-project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifying Properties\n\n\nThe \nDroplet\n's properties can be changed programmatically or through configuration.\n\n\nProgrammatic\n\n\nProperties on the \nDroplet\n are constant and can be overridden through the init method.\n\n\nlet\n \ndrop\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nDroplet\n(\nserver\n:\n \nMyServerType\n.\nself\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the type of server the \nDroplet\n uses is changed to a custom type.

Vapor intends to provide a flexible configuration interaction that can be customized for a given user.\n\n\nQuickStart\n\n\nFor Vapor applications, configuration files are expected to be nested under a top level folder named \nConfig\n. Here's an example of a basic config featuring a single \nservers\n configuration.\n\n\n./\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Config/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 server.json\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd an example of how this might look:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nhost\n:\n \n0.0.0.0\n,\n\n    \nport\n:\n \n8080\n,\n\n    \nsecurityLayer\n:\n \nnone\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat that's saying, is that our application should start a server on port \n8080\n and host \n0.0.0.0\n. This represents the following url: \nhttp://localhost:8080\n.\n\n\nCustom Keys\n\n\nLet's add a custom key to the \nserver.json\n file:\n\n\n{\n\n    \nhost\n:\n \n0.0.0.0\n,\n\n    \nport\n:\n \n8080\n,\n\n    \nsecurityLayer\n:\n \nnone\n,\n\n    \ncustom-key\n:\n \ncustom value\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be accessed from your application's config using the following.\n\n\nlet\n \ncustomValue\n \n=\n \ndrop\n.\nconfig\n[\nserver\n,\n \ncustom-key\n]?.\nstring\n \n??\n \ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it, feel free to add and utilize keys as necessary to make your application configuration easier.\n\n\nConfig Syntax\n\n\nYou can access your config directory with the following syntax. \napp.config[fileName, path, to, key]\n. For example, let's hypothesize that in addition to the \nserver.json\n file we mentioned earlier, there is also a \nkeys.json\n that looks like this:\n\n\n{\n\n  \ntest-names\n:\n \n[\n\n    \njoe\n,\n\n    \njane\n,\n\n    \nsara\n\n  \n],\n\n  \nmongo\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nurl\n \n:\n \nwww.customMongoUrl.com\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can access this file by making sure the first argument in our subscript is keys. To get the first name in our list:\n\n\nlet\n \nname\n \n=\n \ndrop\n.\nconfig\n[\nkeys\n,\n \ntest-names\n,\n \n0\n]?.\nstring\n \n??\n \ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr our mongo url:\n\n\nlet\n \nmongoUrl\n \n=\n \ndrop\n.\nconfig\n[\nkeys\n,\n \nmongo\n,\n \nurl\n]?.\nstring\n \n??\n \ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Configurations\n\n\nHaving the default \nserver.json\n is great, but what about more complex scenarios. For example, what if we want a different host in production and in development? These complex scenarios can be achieved by adding additional folders to our \nConfig/\n directory. Here's an example of a folder structure that's setup for production and development environments.\n\n\nWorkingDirectory/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Config/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 server.json\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 production/\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.json\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 development/\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.json\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 secrets/\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify the environment through the command line by using --env=. Custom environments are also available, a few are provided by default: production, development, and testing.\n\n\n\n\nvapor run --env\n=\nproduction\n\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY\n\n\nConfig files will be accessed in the following priority.\n\n\n\n\nCLI (see below)\n\n\nConfig/secrets/\n\n\nConfig/name-of-environment/\n\n\nConfig/\n\n\n\n\nWhat this means is that if a user calls \napp.config[\"server\", \"host\"]\n, the key will be searched in the CLI first, then the \nsecrets/\n directory, then the top level default configs.\n\n\n\n\nsecrets/\n directory should very likely be added to the gitignore.\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\nLet's start with the following JSON files.\n\n\nserver.json\n\n\n{\n\n    \nhost\n:\n \n0.0.0.0\n,\n\n    \nport\n:\n \n9000\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproduction/server.json\n\n\n{\n\n    \nhost\n:\n \n127.0.0.1\n,\n\n    \nport\n:\n \n$PORT\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n\"$NAME\"\n syntax is available for all values to access environment variables.\n\n\n\n\nPlease notice that \nserver.json\n, and \nproduction/server.json\n both declare the same keys: \nhost\n, and \nport\n. In our application, we'll call:\n\n\n// will load 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 based on above config\n\n\nlet\n \nhost\n \n=\n \ndrop\n.\nconfig\n[\nserver\n,\n \nhost\n]?.\nstring\n \n??\n \n0.0.0.0\n\n\n// will load 9000, or environment variable port.\n\n\nlet\n \nport\n \n=\n \ndrop\n.\nconfig\n[\nserver\n,\n \nport\n]?.\nint\n \n??\n \n9000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration file Options\n\n\ndroplet.json\n\n\n{\n\n    \nserver\n:\n \nengine\n,\n\n    \nclient\n:\n \nengine\n,\n\n    \nconsole\n:\n \nterminal\n,\n\n    \nlog\n:\n \nconsole\n,\n\n    \nhash\n:\n \ncrypto\n,\n\n    \ncipher\n:\n \ncrypto\n,\n\n    \nmiddleware\n:\n \n[\n\n        \nerror\n,\n\n        \ndate\n,\n\n        \nfile\n\n    \n],\n\n    \ncommands\n:\n \n[\n\n        \nprepare\n\n    \n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserver.json\n\n\n{\n\n    \nport\n:\n \n$PORT:8080\n,\n\n    \nhost\n:\n \n0.0.0.0\n,\n\n    \nsecurityLayer\n:\n \nnone\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfluent.json\n\n\n{\n\n    \ndriver\n:\n \nmemory\n,\n\n    \nkeyNamingConvention\n:\n \nsnake_case\n,\n\n    \nmigrationEntityName\n:\n \nfluent\n,\n\n    \npivotNameConnector\n:\n \n_\n,\n\n    \nautoForeignKeys\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n    \ndefaultPageKey\n:\n \npage\n,\n\n    \ndefaultPageSize\n:\n \n10\n,\n\n    \nlog\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n \n    \nmaxConnections\n:\n10\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrypto.json\n\n\n{\n\n    \nhash\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nmethod\n:\n \nsha256\n,\n\n        \nencoding\n:\n \nhex\n,\n\n        \nkey\n:\n \n0000000000000000\n\n    \n},\n\n\n    \ncipher\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nmethod\n:\n \naes256\n,\n\n        \nencoding\n:\n \nbase64\n,\n\n        \nkey\n:\n \nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMAND LINE\n\n\nIn addition to json files nested within the \nConfig/\n directory, we can also use the command line to pass arguments into our config. By default, these values will be set as the \"cli\" file, but more complex options are also available.\n\n\nIf you want command line arguments set to a file besides \"cli\", you can use this more advanced specification. For example, the following CLI command:\n\n\n--config:keys.analytics\n=\n124ZH61F\n\n\n\n\n\nwould be accessible within your application by using the following:\n\n\nlet\n \nanalyticsKey\n \n=\n \ndrop\n.\nconfig\n[\nkeys\n,\n \nanalytics\n]?.\nstring",

It supports common auth patterns such as:\n\n\n\n\nToken (bearer) authentication\n\n\nUsername + password (basic) authentication\n\n\nPermission-based authorization\n\n\nSession-based persistance \n\n\n\n\nAuth's modular, protocol-based nature also makes it a great foundation for custom auth needs.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nUse \nvapor new \nname\n --template=vapor/auth-template\n to create a new \nproject template\n with AuthProvider and samples included.\n\n\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nTo use Auth, you will need to have the \nAuth Provider\n added to your project.\nThis is as simple as adding the following line to your \nPackage.swift\n file.\n\n\n.\nPackage\n(\nurl\n:\n \nhttps://github.com/vapor/auth-provider.git\n,\n \n...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the \nPackage\n section for more information.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nLet's take a look at how we can implement a simple, token-based authentication system using Vapor and Auth.\n\n\nUser\n\n\nWe will start by creating a model to represent our user. If you already have a user class, you can skip this step.\n\n\nimport\n \nVapor\n\n\nimport\n \nFluentProvider\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nclass\n \nExampleUser\n:\n \nModel\n \n{\n\n    \nlet\n \nname\n:\n \nString\n\n\n    \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nextension\n \nExampleUser\n:\n \nPreparation\n \n{\n \n...\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we create a very simple user with just one property: a name.\n\n\n\n\nSeealso\n\n\nWe're omitting most of \nModel\n and \nPreparation\n protocol requirements. Check out Fluent's \n\nGetting Started\n for more information about these protocols.\n\n\n\n\nToken\n\n\nNext let's create a model to represent our authentication tokens. These will be stored in a separate database\ntable or collection called \"tokens\".\n\n\nWhen a user logs in, we will create a new token for them. They will then use this token on subsequent requests\ninstead of their username and password. \n\n\nFor now, here's what our simple token model will look like.\n\n\nimport\n \nVapor\n\n\nimport\n \nFluentProvider\n\n\n\nfinal\n \nclass\n \nExampleToken\n:\n \nModel\n \n{\n\n    \nlet\n \ntoken\n:\n \nString\n\n    \nlet\n \nuserId\n:\n \nIdentifier\n\n\n    \nvar\n \nuser\n:\n \nParent\nExampleToken\n,\n \nExampleUser\n \n{\n\n        \nreturn\n \nparent\n(\nid\n:\n \nuserId\n)\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nextension\n \nExampleToken\n:\n \nPreparation\n \n{\n \n...\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis token has two properties:\n\n\n\n\ntoken: a unique, random string that we will send in requests\n\n\nuserId: the identifier for the user to whom this token belongs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeealso\n\n\nWe're using Fluent relations here.

You can view more about body in the associated \ndocs\n\n\nFor incoming requests, we'll often pull out the associated bytes like so:\n\n\nlet\n \nrawBytes\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nbody\n.\nbytes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent\n\n\nGenerally when we're sending or receiving requests, we're using them as a way to transport content. For this, Vapor provides a convenient \ndata\n variable associated with the request that prioritizes content in a consistent way.\n\n\nFor example, say I receive a request to \nhttp://vapor.codes?hello=world\n.\n\n\nlet\n \nworld\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\ndata\n[\nhello\n]?.\nstring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis same code will work if I receive a JSON request, for example:\n\n\n{\n\n  \nhello\n:\n \nworld\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill still be accessible through data.\n\n\nlet\n \nworld\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\ndata\n[\nhello\n]?.\nstring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Force unwrap should never be used.\n\n\n\n\nThis also applies to multi-part requests and can even be extended to new types such as XML or YAML through middleware.\n\n\nIf you'd prefer to access given types more explicitly, that's totally fine. The \ndata\n variable is purely opt-in convenience for those who want it.\n\n\nForm Data\n\n\nIt is common in many applications to receive forms submitted from a Web browser. Vapor provides support for several common encodings:\n\n\n// Node? from application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n\nlet\n \nformData\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nformURLEncoded\n\n\n\n// [String:Field]? from multipart/form-data\n\n\nlet\n \nmultipartFormData\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nformData\n\n\n\n// [Part]? from multipart/mixed\n\n\nlet\n \nmultipartMixedData\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nmultipart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese accessors will return \nnil\n if the request's \nContent-Type\n does not match what they expect.\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nTo access JSON directly on a given request, use the following:\n\n\nlet\n \njson\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\njson\n[\nhello\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Parameters\n\n\nThe same applies to query convenience:\n\n\nlet\n \nquery\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nquery\n?[\nhello\n]\n  \n// String?\n\n\nlet\n \nname\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nquery\n?[\nname\n]?.\nstring\n \n// String?\n\n\nlet\n \nage\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nquery\n?[\nage\n]?.\nint\n \n// Int?\n\n\nlet\n \nrating\n \n=\n \nrequest\n.\nquery\n?[\nrating\n]?.\ndouble\n \n// Double?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Paths\n\n\nKey paths work on most Vapor types that can have nested key value objects.

Let's start by looking at the most common.\n\n\nCommon Usage\n\n\nSeveral useful convenience validators are included by default. You can use these to validate data coming into your application, or combine them and create your own.\n\n\nLet's look at the most common way to validate data.\n\n\nclass\n \nEmployee\n \n{\n\n    \nvar\n \nemail\n:\n \nValid\nEmail\n\n    \nvar\n \nname\n:\n \nValid\nName\n\n\n    \ninit\n(\nrequest\n:\n \nRequest\n)\n \nthrows\n \n{\n\n        \nname\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nrequest\n.\ndata\n[\nname\n].\nvalidated\n()\n\n        \nemail\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nrequest\n.\ndata\n[\nemail\n].\nvalidated\n()\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have a typical Employee model with an \nemail\n and \nname\n property. By declaring both of these properties as \nValid\n, you are ensuring that these properties can only ever contain valid data. The Swift type checking system will prevent anything that does not pass validation from being stored.\n\n\nTo store something in a \nValid\n property, you must use the \n.validated()\n method. This is available for any data returned by \nrequest.data\n.\n\n\nEmail\n is a real \nvalidator\n included with Vapor, but \nName\n is not. Let's take a look at how you can create a Validator.\n\n\nValid\nOnlyAlphanumeric\n\n\nValid\nEmail\n\n\nValid\nUnique\nT\n\n\nValid\nMatches\nT\n\n\nValid\nIn\nT\n\n\nValid\nContains\nT\n\n\nValid\nCount\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidators vs. ValidationSuites\n\n\nValidators, like \nCount\n or \nContains\n can have multiple configurations. For example:\n\n\nlet\n \nname\n:\n \nValid\nCount\nString\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nVapor\n.\nvalidated\n(\nby\n:\n \nCount\n.\nmax\n(\n5\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we are validating that the \nString\n is at most 5 characters long. The type of \nValid\nCount\n tells us that the string has been validated to be a certain count, but it does not tell us exactly what that count was. The string could have been validated to be less than three characters or more than one million.\n\n\nBecause of this, \nValidators\n themselves are not as type safe as some applications might desire. \nValidationSuites\n fix this. They combine multiple \nValidators\n and/or \nValidationSuites\n together to represent exactly what type of data should be considered valid.\n\n\nCustom Validator\n\n\nHere is how to create a custom \nValidationSuite\n.\n\n\nclass\n \nName\n:\n \nValidationSuite\n \n{\n\n    \nstatic\n \nfunc\n \nvalidate\n(\ninput\n \nvalue\n:\n \nString\n)\n \nthrows\n \n{\n\n        \nlet\n \nevaluation\n \n=\n \nOnlyAlphanumeric\n.\nself\n\n            \n \nCount\n.\nmin\n(\n5\n)\n\n            \n \nCount\n.\nmax\n(\n20\n)\n\n\n        \ntry\n \nevaluation\n.\nvalidate\n(\ninput\n:\n \nvalue\n)\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou only have to implement one method. In this method, use any other validators or logic to create your custom validator. Here we are defining a \nName\n as only accepting alphanumeric Strings that are between 5 and 20 characters.\n\n\nNow we can be sure that anything of type \nValid\nName\n follows these rules.\n\n\nCombining Validators\n\n\nIn the \nName\n validator, you can see that \n is being used to combine validators. You can use \n as well as \n||\n to combine any validator as you would boolean values with an \nif\n statement.\n\n\nYou can also use \n!\n to invert the validator.\n\n\nlet\n \nsymbols\n \n=\n \ninput\n.\nvalidated\n(\nby\n:\n \n!\nOnlyAlphanumeric\n.\nself\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Validity\n\n\nWhile \nvalidated() throw\n is the most common method for validating, there are two others.\n\n\nlet\n \npassed\n \n=\n \ninput\n.\npasses\n(\nCount\n.\nmin\n(\n5\n))\n\n\nlet\n \nvalid\n \n=\n \ntry\n \ninput\n.\ntested\n(\nCount\n.\nmin\n(\n5\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\npasses()\n returns a boolean indicating whether or not the test passed. \ntested()\n will throw if the validation does not pass. But unlike \nvalidated()\n which returns a \nValid\n type, \ntested()\n returns the original type of the item it was called on.\n\n\nValidation Failures\n\n\nVapor will automatically catch validation failures in the \nValidationMiddleware\n. But you can catch them on your own, or customize responses for certain types of failures.\n\n\ndo\n \n{\n\n    \n//validation here\n\n\n}\n \ncatch\n \nlet\n \nerror\n \nas\n \nValidationErrorProtocol\n \n{\n\n    \nprint\n(\nerror\n.\nmessage\n)\n\n\n}",

Node is our attempt at providing a solution to this problem.\n\n\nWhat is Node?\n\n\nNode is a data abstraction with an emphasis on being an intermediary between distinct types. For example, json from a client might use node to convert between the JSON and itself.\n\n\nHow do I use it?\n\n\nNode can be a little different to work with at first if you're familiar with less type-safe languages, let's look at a couple of examples and how we might start using Node in our projects. Most often, we'll be working with Node conversions.\n\n\nNodeInitializable\n\n\nNodeInitializable can be read and understood as \nAn object that can be initialized with a Node\n. Let's look at a simple implementation.\n\n\nstruct\n \nPerson\n:\n \nNodeInitializable\n \n{\n\n    \nlet\n \nname\n:\n \nString\n\n    \nlet\n \nage\n:\n \nInt\n\n\n    \ninit\n(\nnode\n:\n \nNode\n)\n \nthrows\n \n{\n\n        \nname\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nnode\n.\nget\n(\nname\n)\n\n        \nage\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nnode\n.\nget\n(\nage\n)\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have this, we can easily convert abstract data to a Person. Here's how that might look:\n\n\nlet\n \nperson\n \n=\n \ntry\n \nPerson\n(\nnode\n:\n \njson\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: There are some more advanced functionality options for JSON and database Row types in particular, we'll cover that later.\n\n\n\n\nBy conforming our \nPerson\n object to \nNodeInitializable\n, we can also use more advanced cases such as arrays:\n\n\nlet\n \npeople\n \n=\n \ntry\n \n[\nPerson\n](\nnode\n:\n \njsonArray\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodeRepresentable\n\n\nNodeRepresentable can be read and understood as \nAn object that can be represented as a Node\n. Let's take a look at a simple implementation.

            "text": "Deploying with Nginx\n\n\nNginx is an extremely fast, battle tested, and easy-to-configure HTTP server and proxy. While Vapor supports directly serving HTTP requests with or without TLS, proxying behind Nginx can provide increased performance, security, and ease-of-use. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe recommend proxying Vapor HTTP servers behind Nginx.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWhat does it mean to proxy an HTTP server? In short, a proxy acts as a middleman between the public internet and your HTTP server. Requests come to the proxy and then it sends them to Vapor. \n\n\nAn important feature of this middleman proxy is that it can alter or even redirect the requests. For instance, the proxy can require that the client use TLS (https), rate limit requests, or even serve public files without talking to your Vapor application.\n\n\n\n\nMore Detail\n\n\nThe default port for receiving HTTP requests is port \n80\n (and \n443\n for HTTPS). When you bind a Vapor server to port \n80\n, it will directly receive and respond to the HTTP requests that come to your server. When adding a proxy like Nginx, you bind Vapor to an internal port, like port \n8080\n. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPorts greater than 1024 do not require \nsudo\n to bind.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Vapor is bound to a port besides \n80\n or \n443\n, it will not be accessible to the outside internet. You then bind Nginx to port \n80\n and configure it to route requests to your Vapor server bound at port \n8080\n (or whichever port you've chosen).\n\n\nAnd that's it. If Nginx is properly configured, you will see your Vapor app responding to requests on port \n80\n. Nginx proxies the requests and responses invisibly.\n\n\nInstall Nginx\n\n\nThe first step is installing Nginx. One of the great parts of Nginx is the tremendous amount of community resources and documentation surrounding it. Because of this, we will not go into great detail here about installing Nginx as there is almost definitely a tutorial for your specific platform, OS, and provider.\n\n\nTutorials:\n\n\n\n\nHow To Install Nginx on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\n\nHow To Install Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04\n\n\nHow to Deploy Nginx on Heroku\n\n\nHow To Run Nginx in a Docker Container on Ubuntu 14.04\n\n\n\n\nAPT\n\n\nNginx can be installed through APT.\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck whether Nginx was installed correctly by visiting your server's IP address in a browser\n\n\nhttp://server_domain_name_or_IP\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nThe service can be started or stopped.\n\n\nsudo service nginx stop\nsudo service nginx start\nsudo service nginx restart\n\n\n\n\n\nBooting Vapor\n\n\nNginx can be started an stopped with the \nsudo service nginx ...\n commands. You will need something similar to start and stop your Vapor server.\n\n\nThere are many ways to do this, and they depend on which platform you are deploying to. Check out the \nSupervisor\n instructions to add commands for starting and stopping your Vapor app.\n\n\nConfigure Proxy\n\n\nThe configuration files for enabled sites can be found in \n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n.\n\n\nCreate a new file or copy the example template from \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/\n to get started.\n\n\nHere is an example configuration file for a Vapor project called \nHello\n in the home directory.\n\n\nserver \n{\n\n    server_name hello.com\n;\n\n    listen \n80\n;\n\n\n    root /home/vapor/Hello/Public/\n;\n\n\n    location @proxy \n{\n\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080\n;\n\n        proxy_pass_header Server\n;\n\n        proxy_set_header Host \n$host\n;\n\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \n$remote_addr\n;\n\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \n$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for\n;\n\n        proxy_pass_header Server\n;\n\n        proxy_connect_timeout 3s\n;\n\n        proxy_read_timeout 10s\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis configuration file assumes the \nHello\n project binds to port \n8080\n when started in production mode.\n\n\nServing Files\n\n\nNginx can also serve public files without asking your Vapor app. This can improve performance by freeing up the Vapor process for other tasks under heavy load.\n\n\nserver \n{\n\n    ...\n\n    \n# Serve all public/static files via nginx and then fallback to Vapor for the rest\n\n    try_files \n$uri\n @proxy\n;\n\n\n    location @proxy \n{\n\n        ...\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLS\n\n\nAdding TLS is relatively straightforward as long as the certificates have been properly generated.

Requests come to the proxy and then it sends them to Vapor.   An important feature of this middleman proxy is that it can alter or even redirect the requests. For instance, the proxy can require that the client use TLS (https), rate limit requests, or even serve public files without talking to your Vapor application.",

When you bind a Vapor server to port  80 , it will directly receive and respond to the HTTP requests that come to your server. When adding a proxy like Apache2, you bind Vapor to an internal port, like port  8080 .    Note  Ports greater than 1024 do not require  sudo  to bind.   When Vapor is bound to a port besides  80  or  443 , it will not be accessible to the outside internet. You then bind Apache2 to port  80  and configure it to route requests to your Vapor server bound at port  8080  (or whichever port you've chosen).  And that's it. If Apache2 is properly configured, you will see your Vapor app responding to requests on port  80 . Apache2 proxies the requests and responses invisibly.",
