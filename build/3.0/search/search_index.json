If this is your first time hearing about futures, they might seem a little confusing at first. But don't worry, Vapor makes them easy to use. Promises and futures are related, but distinct, types. Promises are used to create futures. Most of the time, you will be working with futures returned by Vapor's APIs and you will not need to worry about creating promises. type description mutability methods Future Reference to an object that may not be available yet. read-only .map(to:_:) .flatMap(to:_:) do(_:) catch(_:) Promise A promise to provide some object asynchronously. read/write succeed(_:) fail(_:) Futures are an alternative to callback-based asynchronous APIs. Futures can be chained and transformed in ways that simple closures cannot, making them quite powerful. Transforming \u00b6 Just like optionals in Swift, futures can be mapped and flat-mapped. These are the most common operations you will perform on futures. method signature description map to: U.Type, _: (T) -> U Maps a future value to a different value. flatMap to: U.Type, _: (T) -> Future<U> Maps a future value to different future value. transform to: U Maps a future to an already available value. If you look at the method signatures for map and flatMap on Optional<T> and Array<T> , you will see that they are very similar to the methods available on Future<T> . Map \u00b6 The .map(to:_:) method allows you to transform the future's value to another value. Because the future's value may not be available yet (it may be the result of an asynchronous task) we must provide a closure to accept the value. /// Assume we get a future string back from some API let futureString : Future < String > = ... /// Map the future string to an integer let futureInt = futureString . map ( to : Int . self ) { string in print ( string ) // The actual String return Int ( string ) ?? 0 } /// We now have a future integer print ( futureInt ) // Future<Int> Flat Map \u00b6 The .flatMap(to:_:) method allows you to transform the future's value to another future value. It gets the name \"flat\" map because it is what allows you to avoid creating nested futures (e.g., Future<Future<T>> ). In other words, it helps you keep your generic futures flat. /// Assume we get a future string back from some API let futureString : Future < String > = ... /// Assume we have created an HTTP client let client : Client = ... /// Flat-map the future string to a future response let futureResponse = futureString . flatMap ( to : Response . self ) { string in return client . get ( string ) // Future<Response> } /// We now have a future response print ( futureResponse ) // Future<Response> Info If we instead used .map(to:_:) in the above example, we would have ended up with a Future<Future<Response>> . Yikes! Transform \u00b6 The .transform(_:) method allows you to modify a future's value, ignoring the existing value. This is especially useful for transforming the results of Future<Void> where the actual value of the future is not important. Tip Future<Void> , sometimes called a signal, is a future whose sole purpose is to notify you of completion or failure of some async operation. /// Assume we get a void future back from some API let userDidSave : Future < Void > = ... /// Transform the void future to an HTTP status let futureStatus = userDidSave . transform ( to : HTTPStatus . ok ) print ( futureStatus ) // Future<HTTPStatus> Even though we have supplied an already-available value to transform , this is still a transformation . The future will not complete until all previous futures have completed (or failed). Chaining \u00b6 The great part about transformations on futures is that they can be chained. This allows you to express many conversions and subtasks easily. Let's modify the examples from above to see how we can take advantage of chaining. /// Assume we get a future string back from some API let futureString : Future < String > = ... /// Assume we have created an HTTP client let client : Client = ... /// Transform the string to a url, then to a response let futureResponse = futureString . map ( to : URL . self ) { string in guard let url = URL ( string : string ) else { throw Abort (. badRequest , reason : \"Invalid URL string: \\( string ) \" ) } return url }. flatMap ( to : Response . self ) { url in return client . get ( url ) } print ( futureResponse ) // Future<Response> After the initial call to map, there is a temporary Future<URL> created. This future is then immediately flat-mapped to a Future<Response> Tip You can throw errors inside of map and flat-map closures. This will result in the future failing with the error thrown. Future \u00b6 Let's take a look at some other, less commonly used methods on Future<T> . Do / Catch \u00b6 Similar to Swift's do / catch syntax, futures have a do and catch method for awaiting the future's result. /// Assume we get a future string back from some API let futureString : Future < String > = ... futureString . do { string in print ( string ) // The actual String }. catch { error in print ( error ) // A Swift Error } Info .do and .catch work together. If you forget .catch , the compiler will warn you about an unused result. Don't forget to handle the error case! Always \u00b6 You can use always to add a callback that will be executed whether the future succeeds or fails. /// Assume we get a future string back from some API let futureString : Future < String > = ... futureString . always { print ( \"The future is complete!\" ) } Note You can add as many callbacks to a future as you want. Wait \u00b6 You can use .wait() to synchronously wait for the future to be completed. Since a future may fail, this call is throwing. /// Assume we get a future string back from some API let futureString : Future < String > = ... /// Block until the string is ready let string = try futureString . wait () print ( string ) /// String Warning Do not use this method in route closures or controllers. Read the section about Blocking for more information. Promise \u00b6 Most of the time, you will be transforming futures returned by calls to Vapor's APIs. However, at some point you may need to create a promise of your own. To create a promise, you will need access to an EventLoop . All containers in Vapor have an eventLoop property that you can use. Most commonly, this will be the current Request . /// Create a new promise for some string let promiseString = req . eventLoop . newPromise ( String . self ) print ( promiseString ) // Promise<String> print ( promiseString . futureResult ) // Future<String> /// Completes the associated future promiseString . succeed ( result : \"Hello\" ) /// Fails the associated future promiseString . fail ( error : ...) Info A promise can only be completed once. Any subsequent completions will be ignored. Thread Safety \u00b6 Promises can be completed ( succeed(result:) / fail(error:) ) from any thread. This is why promises require an event-loop to be initialized. Promises ensure that the completion action gets returned to its event-loop for execution. Event Loop \u00b6 When your application boots, it will usually create one event loop for each core in the CPU it is running on. Each event loop has exactly one thread. If you are familiar with event loops from Node.js, the ones in Vapor are very similar. The only difference is that Vapor can run multiple event loops in one process since Swift supports multi-threading. Each time a client connects to your server, it will be assigned to one of the event loops. From that point on, all communication between the server and that client will happen on that same event loop (and by association, that event loop's thread). The event loop is responsible for keeping track of each connected client's state. If there is a request from the client waiting to be read, the event loop trigger a read notification, causing the data to be read. Once the entire request is read, any futures waiting for that request's data will be completed. Worker \u00b6 Things that have access to an event loop are called Workers . Every container in Vapor is a worker. The most common containers you will interact with in Vapor are: Application Request Response You can use the .eventLoop property on these containers to gain access to the event loop. print ( app . eventLoop ) // EventLoop There are many methods in Vapor that require the current worker to be passed along. It will usually be labeled like on: Worker . If you are in a route closure or a controller, pass the current Request or Response . If you need a worker while booting your app, use the Application . Blocking \u00b6 An absolutely critical rule is the following: Danger Never make blocking calls directly on an event loop. An example of a blocking call would be something like libc.sleep(_:) . router . get ( \"hello\" ) { req in /// Puts the event loop's thread to sleep. sleep ( 5 ) /// Returns a simple string once the thread re-awakens. return \"Hello, world!\" } sleep(_:) is a command that blocks the current thread for the number of seconds supplied. If you do blocking work directly on an event loop, the event loop will be unable to respond to any other clients assigned to it for the duration of the blocking work. In other words, if you do sleep(5) on an event loop, all of the other clients connected to that event loop (possibly hundreds or thousands) will be delayed for at least 5 seconds. Make sure to run any blocking work in the background. Use promises to notify the event loop when this work is done in a non-blocking way. router . get ( \"hello\" ) { req in /// Create a new void promise let promise = req . eventLoop . newPromise ( Void . self ) /// Dispatch some work to happen on a background thread DispatchQueue . global () { /// Puts the background thread to sleep /// This will not affect any of the event loops sleep ( 5 ) /// When the \"blocking work\" has completed, /// complete the promise and its associated future. promise . succeed () } /// Wait for the future to be completed, /// then transform the result to a simple String return promise . futureResult . transform ( to : \"Hello, world!\" ) } Not all blocking calls will be as obvious as sleep(_:) . If you are suspicious that a call you are using may be blocking, research the method itself or ask someone. Chances are if the function is doing disk or network IO and uses a synchronous API (no callbacks or futures) it is blocking. Info If doing blocking work is a central part of your application, you should consider using a BlockingIOThreadPool to control the number of threads you create to do blocking work. This will help you avoid starving your event loops from CPU time while blocking work is being done.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"async/overview/#async-overview","text":"You may have noticed some APIs in Vapor expect or return a generic Future type.

Concept \u00b6 In Computer Science (especially web frameworks), the concept of Authentication means verifying the identity of a user. This is not to be confused with Authorization which verifies privileges to a given resource This package allows you to implement stateless authorization using the following tools: \"Authorization\" header : Used to send credentials in an HTTP request. Middleware : Detects credentials in request and fetches authenticated user. Model : Represents an authenticated user and its identifying information. Authorization Header \u00b6 This packages makes use of two common authorization header formats: basic and bearer. Basic \u00b6 Basic authorization contains a username and password. They are joined together by a : and then base64 encoded. A basic authorization header containing the username Alladin and password OpenSesame would look like this: Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l Although basic authorization can be used to authenticate each request to your server, most web applications usually create an ephemeral token for this purpose instead. Bearer \u00b6 Bearer authorization simply contains a token. A bearer authorization header containing the token cn389ncoiwuencr would look like this: Authorization: Bearer cn389ncoiwuencr The bearer authorization header is very common in APIs since it can be sent easily with each request and contain an ephemeral token. Middleware \u00b6 The usage of Middleware is critical to this package. If you are not familiar with how Middleware works in Vapor, feel free to brush up by reading Vapor \u2192 Middleware . Authentication middleware is responsible for reading the credentials from the request and fetching the identifier user. This usually means checking the \"Authorization\" header, parsing the credentials, and doing a database lookup. For each model / authentication method you use, you will add one middleware to your application. All of this package's middlewares are composable, meaning you can add multiple middlewares to one route and they will work together. If one middleware fails to authorize a user, it will simply forward the request for the next middleware to try. If you would like to ensure that a certain model's authentication has succeeded before running your route, you must add an instance of GuardAuthenticationMiddleware . Model \u00b6 Fluent models are what the middlewares authenticate. Learn more about models by reading Fluent \u2192 Models . If authentication is succesful, the middleware will have fetched your model from the database and stored it on the request. This means you can access an authenticated model synchronously in your route. In your route closure, you use the following methods to check for authentication: authenticated(_:) : Returns type if authenticated, nil if not. isAuthenticated(_:) : Returns true if supplied type is authenticated. requireAuthenticated(_:) : Returns type if authenticated, throws if not. Typical usage looks like the following: // use middleware to protect a group let protectedGroup = router . group (...) // add a protected route protectedGroup . get ( \"test\" ) { req in // require that a User has been authed by middleware or throw let user = try req . requireAuthenticated ( User . self ) // say hello to the user return \"Hello, \\( user . name ) .\" } Methods \u00b6 This package supports two basic types of stateless authentication. Token : Uses the bearer authorization header. Password : Uses the basic authorization header. For each authentication type, there is a separate middleware and model protocol. Password Authentication \u00b6 Password authentication uses the basic authorization header (username and password) to verify a user. With this method, the username and password must be sent with each request to a protected endpoint. To use password authentication, you will first need to conform your Fluent model to PasswordAuthenticatable . extension User : PasswordAuthenticatable { /// See `PasswordAuthenticatable`. static var usernameKey : WritableKeyPath < User , String > { return \\ . email } /// See `PasswordAuthenticatable`. static var passwordKey : WritableKeyPath < User , String > { return \\ . passwordHash } } Note that the passwordKey should point to the hashed password. Never store passwords in plaintext. Once you have created an authenticatable model, the next step is to add middleware to your protected route. // Use user model to create an authentication middleware let password = User . basicAuthMiddleware ( using : BCryptDigest ()) // Create a route closure wrapped by this middleware router . grouped ( password ). get ( \"hello\" ) { req in /// } Here we are using BCryptDigest as the PasswordVerifier since we are assuming the user's password is stored as a BCrypt hash. Now, to fetch the authenticated user in the route closure, you can use requireAuthenticated(_:) . let user = try req . requireAuthenticated ( User . self ) return \"Hello, \\( user . name ) .\" The requireAuthenticated method will automatically throw an appropriate unauthorized error if the valid credentials were not supplied. Because of this, using GuardAuthenticationMiddleware to protect the route from unauthenticated access is not required. Token Authentication \u00b6 Token authentication uses the bearer authorization header (token) to lookup a token and its related user. With this method, the token must be sent with each request to a protected endpoint. Unlike password authentication, token authentication relies on two Fluent models. One for the token and one for the user. The token model should be a child of the user model.

If you are not familiar with how Middleware works in Vapor, feel free to brush up by reading Vapor \u2192 Middleware . Authentication middleware is responsible for reading the credentials from the request and fetching the identifier user. This usually means checking the \"Authorization\" header, parsing the credentials, and doing a database lookup. For each model / authentication method you use, you will add one middleware to your application. All of this package's middlewares are composable, meaning you can add multiple middlewares to one route and they will work together. If one middleware fails to authorize a user, it will simply forward the request for the next middleware to try.

Learn more about models by reading Fluent \u2192 Models . If authentication is succesful, the middleware will have fetched your model from the database and stored it on the request.

In your route closure, you use the following methods to check for authentication: authenticated(_:) : Returns type if authenticated, nil if not. isAuthenticated(_:) : Returns true if supplied type is authenticated. requireAuthenticated(_:) : Returns type if authenticated, throws if not. Typical usage looks like the following: // use middleware to protect a group let protectedGroup = router . group (...) // add a protected route protectedGroup . get ( \"test\" ) { req in // require that a User has been authed by middleware or throw let user = try req . requireAuthenticated ( User . self ) // say hello to the user return \"Hello, \\( user . name ) .\" }","title":"Model"},{"location":"auth/api/#methods","text":"This package supports two basic types of stateless authentication.

Example \u00b6 Let's take a look at a simple session-based authentication example. Pre-requisites \u00b6 In order to do session-based authentication, you must have a way to initially authenticate your user. In other words, you need a method for logging them in.

It helps you do things like manage and pool connections, create keyed caches, and log queries. Many of Vapor's packages such as the Fluent drivers, Redis, and Vapor core are built on top of Database Kit. This guide will walk you through some of the common APIs you might encounter when using Database Kit. Config \u00b6 Your first interaction with Database Kit will most likely be with the DatabasesConfig struct. This type helps you configure one or more databases to your application and will ultimately yield a Databases struct. This usually takes place in configure.swift . // Create a SQLite database. let sqliteDB = SQLiteDatabase (...) // Create a new, empty DatabasesConfig. var dbsConfig = DatabasesConfig () // Register the SQLite database using '.sqlite' as an identifier. dbsConfig . add ( sqliteDB , as : . sqlite ) // Register more DBs here if you want // Register the DatabaseConfig to services. services . register ( dbsConfig ) Using the add(...) methods, you can register Database s to the config. You can register instances of a database, a database type, or a closure that creates a database. The latter two methods will be resolved when your container boots. You can also configure options on your databases, such as enabling logging. // Enable logging on the SQLite database dbsConfig . enableLogging ( for : . sqlite ) See the section on logging for more information. Identifier \u00b6 Most database integrations will provide a default DatabaseIdentifier to use. However, you can always create your own. This is usually done by creating a static extension. extension DatabaseIdentifier { /// Test database. static var testing : DatabaseIdentifier < MySQLDatabase > { return \"testing\" } } DatabaseIdentifier is ExpressibleByStringLiteral which allows you to create one with just a String . Databases \u00b6 Once you have registered a DatabasesConfig to your services and booted a container, you can take advantage of the convenience extensions on Container to start creating connections. // Creates a new connection to `.sqlite` db app . withNewConnection ( to : . sqlite ) { conn in return conn . query (...) // do some db query } Read more about creating and managing connections in the next section. Connections \u00b6 Database Kit's main focus is on creating, managing, and pooling connections. Creating new connections takes a non-trivial amount of time for your application and many cloud services limit the total number of connections to a service that can be open. Because of this, it is important for high-concurrency web applications to manage their connections carefully. Pools \u00b6 A common solution to connection management is the use of connection pools. These pools usually have a set maximum number of connections that are allowed to be open at once. Each time the pool is asked for a connection, it will first check if one is available before creating a new connection. If none are available, it will create a new one. If no connections are available and the pool is already at its maximum, the request for a new connection will wait for a connection to be returned. The easiest way to request and release a pooled connection is the method withPooledConnection(...) . // Requests a pooled connection to `.psql` db req . withPooledConnection ( to : . psql ) { conn in return conn . query (...) // do some db query } This method will request a pooled connection to the identified database and call the provided closure when the connection is available. When the Future returned by the closure has completed, the connection will automatically be returned to the pool. If you need access to a connection outside of a closure, you can use the related request / release methods instead. // Request a connection from the pool and wait for it to be ready. let conn = try app . requestPooledConnection ( to : . psql ). wait () // Ensure the connection is released when we exit this scope. defer { app . releasePooledConnection ( conn , to : . psql ) } You can configure your connection pools using the DatabaseConnectionPoolConfig struct. // Create a new, empty pool config. var poolConfig = DatabaseConnectionPoolConfig () // Set max connections per pool to 8. poolConfig . maxConnections = 8 // Register the pool config. services . register ( poolConfig ) To prevent race conditions, pools are never shared between event loops. There is usually one pool per database per event loop. This means that the amount of connections your application can potentially open to a given database is equal to numThreads * maxConns . New \u00b6 You can always create a new connection to your databases if you need to. This will not affect your pooled connections. Creating new connections is especially useful during testing and app boot. But try not to do it in route closures since heavy traffic to your app could end up creating a lot of connections! Similar to pooled connections, opening and closing new connections can be done using withNewConnection(...) . // Creates a new connection to `.sqlite` db app . withNewConnection ( to : . sqlite ) { conn in return conn . query (...) // do some db query } This method will create a new connection, calling the supplied closure when the connection is open. When the Future returned in the closure completes, the connection will be closed automatically. You can also simply open a new connection with newConnection(...) . // Creates a new connection to `.sqlite` db let conn = try app . newConnection ( to : . sqlite ). wait () // Ensure the connection is closed when we exit this scope. defer { conn . close () } Logging \u00b6 Databases can opt into supporting query logging via the LogSupporting protocol. Databases that conform to this protocol can have loggers configured via DatabasesConfig . // Enable logging on the SQLite database dbsConfig . enableLogging ( for : . sqlite ) By default, a simple print logger will be used, but you can pass a custom DatabaseLogHandler . // Create a custom log handler. let myLogger : DatabaseLogHandler = ... // Enable logging on SQLite w/ custom logger. dbsConfig . enableLogging ( for : . sqlite , logger : myLogger ) Log handlers will receive an instance of DatabaseLog for each logged query. This contains information such as the query, parameterized values, database id, and time. Keyed Cache \u00b6 Databases can opt into supporting keyed-caching via the KeyedCacheSupporting protocol. Databases that conform to this protocol can be used to create instances of DatabaseKeyedCache . Keyed caches are capable of getting, setting, and removing Codable values at keys. They are sometimes called \"key value stores\". To create a keyed cache, you can use the extensions on Container . // Creates a DatabaseKeyedCache with .redis connection pool let cache = try app . keyedCache ( for : . redis ) // Sets \"hello\" = \"world\" try cache . set ( \"hello\" , to : \"world\" ). wait () // Gets \"hello\" let world = try cache . get ( \"hello\" , as : String . self ). wait () print ( world ) // \"world\" // Removes \"hello\" try cache . remove ( \"hello\" ). wait () See the KeyedCache protocol for more information.

The easiest way to request and release a pooled connection is the method withPooledConnection(...) . // Requests a pooled connection to `.psql` db req . withPooledConnection ( to : . psql ) { conn in return conn . query (...) // do some db query } This method will request a pooled connection to the identified database and call the provided closure when the connection is available.

It can serve as a jumping off point within your organization (or yourself) for how to write code in a style that aligns with the Vapor ecosystem. We think this guide can help solidify common ideas that occur across most applications and will be a reference for maintainers when starting a new project. This style guide is opinionated, so you should adapt your code in places where you don\u2019t agree. Contributing \u00b6 To contribute to this guide, please submit a pull request that includes your proposed changes as well as logic to support your addition or modification. Pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers and the rationale behind the maintainers\u2019 decision to accept or deny the changes will be posted in the pull request. Application Structure \u00b6 The structure of your Vapor application is important from a readability standpoint, but also in terms of functionality. Application structure refers to a few different aspects of the Vapor ecosystem, but in particular, it is the way in which you structure your file, folders, and assets. The preferred way to structure your application is by separating the application into a few main parts: Controllers Middleware Models Setup Utilities Services The structure ensures that new members working on your project can easily find the file or asset they are looking for. Controllers Folder \u00b6 The controllers folder houses all of the controllers for your application which correspond to your routes. If you are building an application that serves both API responses and frontend responses, this folder should be further segmented into an API Controllers folder and a View Controllers folder. Middleware Folder \u00b6 The middleware folder contains any custom middleware that you\u2019ve written for your application. Each piece of middleware should be descriptively named and should only be responsible for one piece of functionality. Models Folder \u00b6 \u201cModels\u201d in this document means an object that can be used to store or return data throughout the application. Models are not specific to Fluent - Entities, however, include database information that make it possible to persist and query them. The Models folder should be broken down into four parts: Entities, Requests, Responses, and View Contexts (if applicable to your application). The Requests and Responses folder hold object files that are used to decode requests or encode responses. For more information on this, see the \u201cFile Naming\u201d section. If your application handles view rendering via Leaf, you should also have a folder that holds all of your view contexts. These contexts are the same type of objects as the Request and Response objects, but are specifically for passing data to the view layer. The Entities folder is further broken up into a folder for each database model that exists within your application. For example, if you have a User model that represents a users table, you would have a Users folder that contains User.swift (the Fluent model representation) and then any other applicable files for this entity. Other common files found at this level include files to extend functionality of the object, repository protocols/implementations, and data transformation extensions. Setup Folder \u00b6 The setup folder has all of the necessary pieces that are called on application setup. This includes app.swift , boot.swift , configure.swift , migrate.swift , and routes.swift . For information on each of these files, see the \u201cConfiguration\u201d section. Utilities Folder \u00b6 The utilities folder serves as a general purpose location for any objects or helpers that don\u2019t fit the other folders. For example, in your quest to eliminate stringly-typed code (see the \u201cGeneral Advice\u201d section) you might place a Constants.swift file in this location. Services Folder \u00b6 The services folder is used to hold any custom services that are created and registered. The final application structure (inside the Sources folder) looks like this: \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 API\\ Controllers \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 View\\ Controllers \u251c\u2500\u2500 Middleware \u251c\u2500\u2500 Models \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Entities \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 User \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Requests \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Responses \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 View\\ Contexts \u251c\u2500\u2500 Setup \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 boot.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 commands.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 configure.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 content.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 databases.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 middlewares.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 migrate.swift \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 repositories.swift \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 routes.swift \u251c\u2500\u2500 Utilities \u251c\u2500\u2500 Services Configuration \u00b6 Configuring your application correctly is one of the most important parts of a successful Vapor application. The main function of the configuring a Vapor application is correctly registering all of your services and 3rd party providers. Note : For more information on registering credentials and secrets, see the \u201cCredentials\u201d section. Files \u00b6 Depending on your application you should have some or all of the following files: app.swift (use the default template version) boot.swift (use the default template version) commands.swift (Optional) configure.swift content.swift databases.swift (Optional) middlewares.swift migrate.swift (Optional) repositories.swift (Optional) routes.swift configure.swift \u00b6 Use this file to register your services, providers, and any other code that needs to run as part of the Vapor application setup process. We recommend registering all services (with some exceptions, like BlockingIOThreadPool , that have internal synchronization code) using the closure method. The closure gets called each time a container requests that service. There's one container per thread, meaning that you get one service per thread. As a result, you don't need to think about synchronizing access and state in the object, which is otherwise difficult. The tradeoff to this method is memory usage, which is typically negligible for a small class, but you gain performance. routes.swift \u00b6 The routes.swift file is used to declare route registration for your application. Typically, the routes.swift file looks like this: import Vapor public func routes ( _ router : Router , _ container : Container ) throws { try router . register ( collection : MyControllerHere ( db : container . connectionPool ( to : . mysql ))) } You should call this function from configure.swift like this: services . register ( Router . self ) { container -> EngineRouter in let router = EngineRouter . default () try routes ( router , container ) return router } For more information on routes, see the \u201cRoutes and Controllers\u201d section. commands.swift \u00b6 Use this file to add your custom commands to your application. For example: import Vapor public func commands ( config : inout CommandConfig ) { config . useFluentCommands () config . use ( MyCustomCommand (), as : \"my-custom-command\" ) ... } You should call this function from configure.swift like this: /// Command Config var commandsConfig = CommandConfig . default () commands ( config : & commandsConfig ) services . register ( commandsConfig ) If your app doesn't use custom Command s you can omit this file. content.swift \u00b6 In this file you can customize the content encoding/decoding configuration for your data models. For example: import Vapor public func content ( config : inout ContentConfig ) throws { let encoder = JSONEncoder () let decoder = JSONDecoder () encoder . dateEncodingStrategy = . millisecondsSince1970 decoder . dateDecodingStrategy = . millisecondsSince1970 config . use ( encoder : encoder , for : . json ) config . use ( decoder : decoder , for : . json ) } You should call this function from configure.swift like this: /// Register Content Config var contentConfig = ContentConfig . default () try content ( config : & contentConfig ) services . register ( contentConfig ) If you don't customize the content configuration you can omit this file. databases.swift \u00b6 Use this file to add the databases used in your application. Extracting this logic to a separate file keeps the configure.swift code clean, as it can often get quite long. This file should look something like this: import Vapor import FluentMySQL //use your database driver here public func databases ( config : inout DatabasesConfig ) throws { guard let databaseUrl = Environment . get ( \"DATABASE_URL\" ) else { throw Abort (. internalServerError ) } guard let dbConfig = MySQLDatabaseConfig ( url : databaseUrl ) else { throw Abort (. internalServerError ) } /// Register the databases config . add ( database : MySQLDatabase ( config : dbConfig ), as : . mysql ) ... } And then call this function from configure.swift like this: /// Register the configured SQLite database to the database config. var databasesConfig = DatabasesConfig () try databases ( config : & databasesConfig ) services . register ( databasesConfig ) If your app doesn't use Fluent you can omit this file. middlewares.swift \u00b6 In this file you can customize the middlewares of your application. For example: import Vapor public func middlewares ( config : inout MiddlewareConfig ) throws { // config.use(FileMiddleware.self) // Serves files from `Public/` directory config . use ( ErrorMiddleware . self ) // Catches errors and converts to HTTP response // Other Middlewares... } You should call this function from configure.swift like this: /// Register middlewares var middlewaresConfig = MiddlewareConfig () try middlewares ( config : & middlewaresConfig ) services . register ( middlewaresConfig ) migrate.swift \u00b6 Use this file to add the migrations to your database. Extracting this logic to a separate file keeps the configure.swift code clean, as it can often get quite long. This file should look something like this: import Vapor import FluentMySQL //use your database driver here public func migrate ( migrations : inout MigrationConfig ) throws { migrations . add ( model : User . self , database : . mysql ) //update this with your database driver } And then call this function from configure.swift like this: services . register { container -> MigrationConfig in var migrationConfig = MigrationConfig () try migrate ( migrations : & migrationConfig ) return migrationConfig } As you continue to add models to your application, make sure that you add them to the migration file as well. If your app doesn't use Fluent you can omit this file. repositories.swift \u00b6 The repositories.swift file is responsible for registering each repository during the configuration stage. This file should look like this: import Vapor public func setupRepositories ( services : inout Services , config : inout Config ) { services . register ( MySQLUserRepository . self ) preferDatabaseRepositories ( config : & config ) } private func preferDatabaseRepositories ( config : inout Config ) { config . prefer ( MySQLUserRepository . self , for : UserRepository . self ) } Call this function from configure.swift like this: setupRepositories ( services : & services , config : & config ) For more information on the repository pattern, see the \u201cArchitecture\u201d section. If your app doesn't use Fluent you can omit this file. Credentials \u00b6 Credentials are a crucial part to any production-ready application. The preferred way to manage secrets in a Vapor application is via environment variables. These variables can be set via the Xcode scheme editor for testing, the shell, or in the GUI of your hosting provider. Credentials should never, under any circumstances, be checked into a source control repository. Assuming we have the following credential storage service: import Vapor struct APIKeyStorage : Service { let apiKey : String } Bad: services . register { container -> APIKeyStorage in return APIKeyStorage ( apiKey : \"MY-SUPER-SECRET-API-KEY\" ) } Good: guard let apiKey = Environment . get ( \"api-key\" ) else { throw Abort (. internalServerError ) } services . register { container -> APIKeyStorage in return APIKeyStorage ( apiKey : apiKey ) } File Naming \u00b6 As the old saying goes, \u201cthe two hardest problems in computer science are naming things, cache invalidation, and off by one errors.\u201d To minimize confusion and help increase readability, files should be named succinctly and descriptively. Files that contain objects used to decode body content from a request should be appended with Request . For example, LoginRequest . Files that contain objects used to encode body content to a response should be appended with Response . For example, LoginResponse . Controllers should also be named descriptively for their purpose. If your application contains logic for frontend responses and API responses, each controller\u2019s name should denote their responsibility. For example, LoginViewController and LoginController . If you combine the login functionality into one controller, opt for the more generic name: LoginController . Architecture \u00b6 One of the most important decisions to make up front about your app is the style of architecture it will follow. It is incredibly time consuming and expensive to retroactively change your architecture. We recommend that production-level Vapor applications use the repository pattern. The basic idea behind the repository pattern is that it creates another abstraction between Fluent and your application code. Instead of using Fluent queries directly in controllers, this pattern encourages abstracting those queries into a more generic protocol and using that instead. There are a few benefits to this method. First, it makes testing a lot easier. This is because during the test environment you can easily utilize Vapor\u2019s configuration abilities to swap out which implementation of the repository protocol gets used. This makes unit testing much faster because the unit tests can use a memory version of the protocol rather than the database. The other large benefit to this pattern is that it makes it really easy to switch out the database layer if needed. Because all of the ORM logic is abstracted to this piece of the application (and the controllers don\u2019t know it exists) you could realistically swap out Fluent with a different ORM with minimal changes to your actual application/business logic code. This also means that you could switch out the specific database used during testing (i.e. using SQLite instead of MySQL). However, this strategy requires extra work to make your models generic as they can no longer conform the the specific database model types (e.g. MySQLModel ). Here\u2019s an example of a UserRepository : import Vapor import FluentMySQL import Foundation protocol UserRepository : ServiceType { func find ( id : Int ) -> Future < User ? > func all () -> Future < [ User ] > func find ( email : String ) -> Future < User ? > func findCount ( email : String ) -> Future < Int > func save ( user : User ) -> Future < User > } final class MySQLUserRepository : UserRepository { let db : MySQLDatabase . ConnectionPool init ( _ db : MySQLDatabase . ConnectionPool ) { self . db = db } func find ( id : Int ) -> EventLoopFuture < User ? > { return db . withConnection { conn in return User . find ( id , on : conn ) } } func all () -> EventLoopFuture < [ User ] > { return db . withConnection { conn in return User . query ( on : conn ). all () } } func find ( email : String ) -> EventLoopFuture < User ? > { return db . withConnection { conn in return User . query ( on : conn ). filter ( \\ . email == email ). first () } } func findCount ( email : String ) -> EventLoopFuture < Int > { return db . withConnection { conn in return User . query ( on : conn ). filter ( \\ . email == email ). count () } } func save ( user : User ) -> EventLoopFuture < User > { return db . withConnection { conn in return user . save ( on : conn ) } } } // MARK: - ServiceType conformance extension MySQLUserRepository { static let serviceSupports : [ Any . Type ] = [ UserRepository . self ] static func makeService ( for worker : Container ) throws -> Self { return . init ( try worker . connectionPool ( to : . mysql )) } } extension Database { public typealias ConnectionPool = DatabaseConnectionPool < ConfiguredDatabase < Self > > } Then, in the controller: let repository = try req . make ( UserRepository . self ) let userQuery = repository . find ( email : content . email ) . unwrap ( or : Abort (. unauthorized , reason : \"Invalid Credentials\" )) In this example, the controller has no idea where the data is coming from, it only knows that it exists. This model has proven to be incredibly effective with Vapor and it is our recommended architecture. Entities \u00b6 Oftentimes entities that come from the database layer need to be transformed to make them appropriate for a JSON response or for sending to the view layer. Sometimes these data transformations require database queries as well. If the transformation is simple, use a property and not a function. Bad: func publicUser () -> PublicUser { return PublicUser ( user : self ) } Good: var ` public `: PublicUser { return PublicUser ( user : self ) } Transformations that require more complex processing (fetching siblings and add them to the object) should be functions that accept a DatabaseConnectable object: func userWithSiblings ( on connectable : DatabaseConnectable ) throws -> Future < FullUser > { //do the processing here } We also recommend documenting all functions that exist on entities. Unless your entity needs to be database-generic, always conform the model to the most specific model type. Bad: extension User : Model { } Good: extension User : MySQLModel { } Extending the model with other conformances (Migration, Parameter, etc) should be done at the file scope via an extension. Bad: public final class User : Model , Parameter , Content , Migration { //.. } Good: public final class User { //.. } extension User : MySQLModel { } extension User : Parameter { } extension User : Migration { } extension User : Content { } Property naming styles should remain consistent throughout all models. Bad: public final class User { var id : Int ? var firstName : String var last_name : String } Good: public final class User { var id : Int ? var firstName : String var lastName : String } As a general rule, try to abstract logic into functions on the models to keep the controllers clean. Routes and Controllers \u00b6 We suggest combining your routes into your controller to keep everything central. Controllers serve as a jumping off point for executing logic from other places, namely repositories and model functions. Routes should be separated into functions in the controller that take a Request parameter and return a ResponseEncodable type. Bad: final class LoginViewController : RouteCollection { func boot ( router : Router ) throws { router . get ( \"/login\" ) { ( req ) -> ResponseEncodable in return \"\" } } } Good: final class LoginViewController : RouteCollection { func boot ( router : Router ) throws { router . get ( \"/login\" , use : login ) } func login ( req : Request ) throws -> String { return \"\" } } When creating these route functions, the return type should always be as specific as possible. Bad: func login ( req : Request ) throws -> ResponseEncodable { return \"string\" } Good: func login ( req : Request ) throws -> String { return \"string\" } When creating a path like /user/:userId , always use the most specific Parameter instance available. Bad: router . get ( \"/user\" , Int . parameter , use : user ) Good: router . get ( \"/user\" , User . parameter , use : user ) When decoding a request, opt to decode the Content object when registering the route instead of in the route. Bad: router . post ( \"/update\" , use : update ) func update ( req : Request ) throws -> Future < User > { return req . content . decode ( User . self ). map { user in //do something with user return user } } Good: router . post ( User . self , at : \"/update\" , use : update ) func update ( req : Request , content : User ) throws -> Future < User > { return content . save ( on : req ) } Controllers should follow the thread-safe architecture when possible. This means passing necessary Service s to the controller on initialization instead of making them in the routes. Bad: final class LoginViewController : RouteCollection { func boot ( router : Router ) throws { router . get ( \"/login\" , use : login ) } func login ( req : Request ) throws -> String { let userRepository = try req . make ( UserRepository . self ) //do something with it return \"\" } } Good: final class LoginViewController : RouteCollection { private let userRepository : UserRepository init ( userRepository : UserRepository ) { self . userRepository = userRepository } func boot ( router : Router ) throws { router . get ( \"/login\" , use : login ) } func login ( req : Request ) throws -> String { //use `self.userRepository` return \"\" } } Controllers should only cover one idea/feature at a time. If a feature grows to encapsulate a large amount of functionality, routes should be split up into multiple controllers and organized under one common feature folder in the Controllers folder. For example, an app that handles generating a lot of analytical/reporting views should break up the logic by specific report to avoid cluttering a generic ReportsViewController.swift Async \u00b6 Where possible, avoid specifying the type information in flatMap and map calls. Bad: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . map ( to : Response . self ) { string in return req . redirect ( to : string ) } Good: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . map { string in return req . redirect ( to : string ) } When returning two objects from a chain to the next chain, use the and(result: ) function to automatically create a tuple instead of manually creating it (the Swift compiler will most likely require return type information in this case) Bad: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . flatMap ( to : ( String , String ). self ) { original in let otherStringFuture : Future < String > return otherStringFuture . map { other in return ( other , original ) } }. map { other , original in //do something } Good: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . flatMap ( to : ( String , String ). self ) { original in let otherStringFuture : Future < String > return otherStringFuture . and ( result : original ) }. map { other , original in //do something } When returning more than two objects from one chain to the next, do not rely on the and(result ) method as it can only create, at most, a two object tuple. Use a nested map instead. Bad: let stringFuture : Future < String > let secondFuture : Future < String > return flatMap ( to : ( String , ( String , String )). self , stringFuture , secondFuture ) { first , second in let thirdFuture : Future < String > return thirdFuture . and ( result : ( first , second )) }. map { other , firstSecondTuple in let first = firstSecondTuple . 0 let second = firstSecondTuple . 1 //do something } Good: let stringFuture : Future < String > let secondFuture : Future < String > return flatMap ( to : ( String , String , String ). self , stringFuture , secondFuture ) { first , second in let thirdFuture : Future < String > return thirdFuture . map { third in return ( first , second , third ) } }. map { first , second , third in //do something } Always use the global flatMap and map methods to execute futures concurrently when the functions don\u2019t need to wait on each other. Bad: let stringFuture : Future < String > let secondFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . flatMap { string in print ( string ) return secondFuture }. map { second in print ( second ) //finish chain } Good: let stringFuture : Future < String > let secondFuture : Future < String > return flatMap ( to : Void . self , stringFuture , secondFuture ) { first , second in print ( first ) print ( second ) return . done ( on : req ) } Avoid nesting async functions more than once per chain, as it becomes unreadable and unsustainable. Bad: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . flatMap { first in let secondStringFuture : Future < String > return secondStringFuture . flatMap { second in let thirdStringFuture : Future < String > return thirdStringFuture . flatMap { third in print ( first ) print ( second ) print ( third ) return . done ( on : req ) } } } Good: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . flatMap ( to : ( String , String ). self ) { first in let secondStringFuture : Future < String > return secondStringFuture . and ( result : first ) }. flatMap { second , first in let thirdStringFuture : Future < String > //it's ok to nest once return thirdStringFuture . flatMap { third in print ( first ) print ( second ) print ( third ) return . done ( on : req ) } } Use transform(to: ) to avoid chaining an extra, unnecessary level. Bad: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . map { _ in return . ok } Good: let stringFuture : Future < String > return stringFuture . transform ( to : . ok ) Avoid synchronous throwing where possible as it can lead to undefined behavior in the route, specifically because running IO operations may not finish before the route ends. Bad: func index ( _ req : Request ) throws -> Future < View > { let models = SomeModel . query ( on : req ). all () guard someCondition else { throw SomeError (...) } return req . view (). render ( \"someView\" , [ \"models\" : models ]) } Good: func index ( _ req : Request ) throws -> Future < View > { let modelsFuture = SomeModel . query ( on : req ). all () return modelsFuture . flatMap { models in guard someCondition else { throw SomeError (...) } return req . view (). render ( \"someView\" , [ \"models\" : models ]) } } Testing \u00b6 Testing is a crucial part of Vapor applications that helps ensure feature parity across versions. We strongly recommend testing for all Vapor applications. While testing routes, avoid changing behavior only to accommodate for the testing environment. Instead, if there is functionality that should differ based on the environment, you should create a service and swap out the selected version during the testing configuration. Bad: func login ( req : Request ) throws -> Future < View > { if req . environment != . testing { try req . verifyCSRF () } //rest of the route } Good: func login ( req : Request ) throws -> Future < View > { let csrf = try req . make ( CSRF . self ) try csrf . verify ( req : req ) //rest of the route } Note how the correct way of handling this situation includes making a service - this is so that you can mock out fake functionality in the testing version of the service. Every test should setup and teardown your database. Do not try and persist state between tests. Tests should be separated into unit tests and integration. If using the repository pattern, the unit tests should use the memory version of the repositories while the integration tests should use the database version of the repositories. Fluent \u00b6 ORMs are notorious for making it really easy to write bad code that works but is terribly inefficient or incorrect. Fluent tends to minimize this possibility thanks to the usage of features like KeyPaths and strongly-typed decoding, but there are still a few things to watch out for. Actively watch out for and avoid code that produces N+1 queries. Queries that have to be run for every instance of a model are bad and typically produce N+1 problems. Another identifying feature of N+1 code is the combination of a loop (or map ) with flatten . Bad: //assume this is filled and that each owner can have one pet let owners = [ Owner ]() var petFutures = [ Future < Pet >]() for owner in owners { let petFuture = try Pet . find ( owner . petId , on : req ). unwrap ( or : Abort (. badRequest )) petFutures . append ( petFuture ) } let allPets = petFutures . flatten ( on : req ) Good: //assume this is filled and that each owner can have one pet let owners = [ Owner ]() let petIds = owners . compactMap { $0 . petId } let allPets = try Pet . query ( on : req ). filter ( \\ . id ~~ petIds ). all () Notice the use of the ~~ infix operator which creates an IN SQL query. In addition to reducing Fluent inefficiencies, opt for using native Fluent queries over raw queries unless your intended query is too complex to be created using Fluent. Bad: conn . raw ( \"SELECT * FROM users;\" ) Good: User . query ( on : req ). all () Leaf \u00b6 Creating clean, readable Leaf files is important. One of the ways to go about doing this is through the use of base templates. Base templates allow you to specify only the different part of the page in the main leaf file for that view, and then base template will sub in the common components of the page (meta headers, the page footer, etc). For example: base.leaf <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- HTML5 --> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > <!-- Basic Meta --> < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" > < meta http-equiv = \"x-ua-compatible\" content = \"ie=edge\" > < title > #get(title) </ title > </ head > < body > #get(body) #embed(\"Views/footer\") </ body > </ html > Notice the calls to #get and #embed which piece together the supplied variables from the view and create the final HTML page. login.leaf #set(\"title\") { Login } #set(\"body\") { < p > Add your login page here </ p > } #embed(\"Views/base\") In addition to extracting base components to one file, you should also extract common components to their own file. For example, instead of repeating the snippet to create a bar graph, put it inside of a different file and then use #embed() to pull it into your main view. Always use req.view() to render the views for your frontend. This will ensure that the views will take advantage of caching in production mode, which dramatically speeds up your frontend responses. Errors \u00b6 Depending on the type of application you are building (frontend, API-based, or hybrid) the way that you throw and handle errors may differ. For example, in an API-based system, throwing an error generally means you want to return it as a response. However, in a frontend system, throwing an error most likely means that you will want to handle it further down the line to give the user contextual frontend information. As a general rule of thumb, conform all of your custom error types to Debuggable. That helps ErrorMiddleware print better diagnostics and can lead to easier debugging. Bad: enum CustomError : Error { case error } Good: enum CustomError : Debuggable { case error // MARK: - Debuggable var identifier : String { switch self { case . error : return \"error\" } } var reason : String { switch self { case . error : return \"Specify reason here\" } } } Include a reason when throwing generic Abort errors to indicate the context of the situation. Bad: throw Abort (. badRequest ) Good: throw Abort (. badRequest , reason : \"Could not get data from external API.\" ) 3rd Party Providers \u00b6 When building third party providers for Vapor, it's important to have a certain consistency that users will be able to become familiar with when switching or adding new providers. Although Vapor is very young, there are already certain patterns that make sense when writing providers. When creating a provider library, you should omit phrases like Provider or Package . Take the StripeProvider for example, while the name of the project itself can be named StripeProvider the library name should be just the product itself: let package = Package ( name : \"StripeProvider\" , products : [ . library ( name : \"Stripe\" , targets : [ \"Stripe\" ]) ], ) This allows for easy to read and clean import statements: import Stripe rather than import StripeProvider . Overall Advice \u00b6 Use //MARK: to denote sections of your controllers or configuration so that it is easier for other project members to find critically important areas. Only import modules that are needed for that specific file. Adding extra modules creates bloat and makes it difficult to deduce that controller\u2019s responsibility. Where possible, use Swift doc-blocks to document methods. This is especially important for methods implements on entities so that other project members understand how the function affects persisted data. Do not retrieve environment variables on a repeated basis. Instead, use a custom service and register those variables during the configuration stage of your application (see \u201cConfiguration\u201d) Reuse DateFormatters where possible (while also maintaining thread safety). In particular, don\u2019t create a date formatter inside of a loop as they are expensive to make. Store dates in a computer-readable format until the last possible moment when they must be converted to human-readable strings. That conversion is typically very expensive and is unnecessary when passing dates around internally. Offloading this responsibility to JavaScript is a great tactic as well if you are building a front-end application. Eliminate stringly-typed code where possible by storing frequently used strings in a file like Constants.swift .

It is incredibly time consuming and expensive to retroactively change your architecture. We recommend that production-level Vapor applications use the repository pattern. The basic idea behind the repository pattern is that it creates another abstraction between Fluent and your application code. Instead of using Fluent queries directly in controllers, this pattern encourages abstracting those queries into a more generic protocol and using that instead. There are a few benefits to this method. First, it makes testing a lot easier. This is because during the test environment you can easily utilize Vapor\u2019s configuration abilities to swap out which implementation of the repository protocol gets used. This makes unit testing much faster because the unit tests can use a memory version of the protocol rather than the database. The other large benefit to this pattern is that it makes it really easy to switch out the database layer if needed. Because all of the ORM logic is abstracted to this piece of the application (and the controllers don\u2019t know it exists) you could realistically swap out Fluent with a different ORM with minimal changes to your actual application/business logic code. This also means that you could switch out the specific database used during testing (i.e. using SQLite instead of MySQL). However, this strategy requires extra work to make your models generic as they can no longer conform the the specific database model types (e.g. MySQLModel ). Here\u2019s an example of a UserRepository : import Vapor import FluentMySQL import Foundation protocol UserRepository : ServiceType { func find ( id : Int ) -> Future < User ? > func all () -> Future < [ User ] > func find ( email : String ) -> Future < User ? > func findCount ( email : String ) -> Future < Int > func save ( user : User ) -> Future < User > } final class MySQLUserRepository : UserRepository { let db : MySQLDatabase .

One of the ways to go about doing this is through the use of base templates. Base templates allow you to specify only the different part of the page in the main leaf file for that view, and then base template will sub in the common components of the page (meta headers, the page footer, etc). For example: base.leaf <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- HTML5 --> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > <!-- Basic Meta --> < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" > < meta http-equiv = \"x-ua-compatible\" content = \"ie=edge\" > < title > #get(title) </ title > </ head > < body > #get(body) #embed(\"Views/footer\") </ body > </ html > Notice the calls to #get and #embed which piece together the supplied variables from the view and create the final HTML page. login.leaf #set(\"title\") { Login } #set(\"body\") { < p > Add your login page here </ p > } #embed(\"Views/base\") In addition to extracting base components to one file, you should also extract common components to their own file. For example, instead of repeating the snippet to create a bar graph, put it inside of a different file and then use #embed() to pull it into your main view.

Take the StripeProvider for example, while the name of the project itself can be named StripeProvider the library name should be just the product itself: let package = Package ( name : \"StripeProvider\" , products : [ . library ( name : \"Stripe\" , targets : [ \"Stripe\" ]) ], ) This allows for easy to read and clean import statements: import Stripe rather than import StripeProvider .","title":"3rd Party Providers"},{"location":"extras/style-guide/#overall-advice","text":"Use //MARK: to denote sections of your controllers or configuration so that it is easier for other project members to find critically important areas.

It takes advantage of Swift's strong type system to provide an elegant foundation for building database integrations. Choosing a Driver \u00b6 Fluent is a framework for building ORMs, not an ORM itself. To use Fluent, you will first need to choose a database driver to use. Fluent can support multiple databases and database drivers per application. Below is a list of officially supported database drivers for Fluent. database repo version dbid notes PostgreSQL fluent-postgresql 1.0.0 psql Recommended . Open source, standards compliant SQL database. Available on most cloud hosting providers. MySQL fluent-mysql 3.0.0 mysql Popular open source SQL database. Available on most cloud hosting providers. This driver also supports MariaDB. SQLite fluent-sqlite 3.0.0 sqlite Open source, embedded SQL database. Its simplistic nature makes it a great candiate for prototyping and testing. MongoDB fluent-mongo n/a mongo Coming soon. Popular NoSQL database. Note Replace any Xcode placholders ( <#...#> ) in the code snippets below with information from the above table. You can search GitHub for the tag fluent-database for a full list of official and third-party Fluent database drivers. Package \u00b6 Once you have decided which driver you want, the next step is adding it as a dependency to your project in your SPM package manifest file. // swift-tools-version:4.0 import PackageDescription let package = Package ( name : \"MyApp\" , dependencies : [ /// Any other dependencies ... . package ( url : \"https://github.com/vapor/<#repo#>.git\" , from : \"<#version#>\" ), ], targets : [ . target ( name : \"App\" , dependencies : [ \"Fluent<#Database#>\" , ...]), . target ( name : \"Run\" , dependencies : [ \"App\" ]), . testTarget ( name : \"AppTests\" , dependencies : [ \"App\" ]), ] ) Don't forget to add the module as a dependency in the targets array. Once you have added the dependency, regenerate your Xcode project with the following command: vapor xcode Creating a Model \u00b6 Now let's create your first model. Models represent tables in your database and they are the primary method of interacting with your data. Each driver provides convenience model protocols ( PostgreSQLModel , SQLiteModel , etc) that extend Fluent's base Model protocol. These convenience types make declaring models more concise by using standard values for ID key and type. Fill in the Xcode placeholders below with the name of your chosen database, i.e., PostgreSQL . import Fluent < # Database # > import Vapor /// A simple user. final class User : < # Database # > Model { /// The unique identifier for this user. var id : ID ? /// The user's full name. var name : String /// The user's current age in years. var age : Int /// Creates a new user. init ( id : ID ? = nil , name : String , age : Int ) { self . id = id self . name = name self . age = age } } extension User : Content { } The example above shows a simple model representing a user. You can make both structs and classes a model. You can even conform types that come from external modules. The only requirement is that these types conform to Codable , which must be declared on the base type for synthesized (automatic) conformance. Note: Content conformance will ensure that the object can be encoded and decoded from HTTP messages. This will be necessary when performing a query. Take a look at Fluent \u2192 Model for more information on creating models with custom ID types and keys. Configuring the Database \u00b6 Now that you have a model, you can configure your database. This is done in configure.swift . Register Provider \u00b6 The first step is to register your database driver's provider. import Fluent < # Database # > import Vapor // Register providers first try services . register ( Fluent < # Database # > Provider ()) // Other services.... Registering the provider will add all of the services required for your Fluent database to work properly. It also includes a default database config struct that uses typical development environment credentials. Custom Credentials \u00b6 If you are using default configuration for your database (such as default credentials or other config) then this may be the only setup you need to perform. See the documentation for your specific database type for more information about custom configuration. database docs api docs PostgreSQL PostgreSQL \u2192 Getting Started PostgreSQLDatabase MySQL MySQL \u2192 Getting Started MySQLDatabase SQLite SQLite \u2192 Getting Started SQLiteDatabase Creating a Migration \u00b6 If your database driver uses schemas (is a SQL database), you will need to create a Migration for your new model. Migrations allow Fluent to create a table for your model in a reliable, testable way. You can later create additional migrations to update or delete the model's table or even manipulate data in the table. To create a migration, you will normally first create a new struct or class to hold the migration. However, models can take advantage of a convenient shortcut. When you create a migration from an existing model type, Fluent can infer an appropriate schema from the model's codable properties. You can add the migration conformance to a model as an extension or on the base type declaration. import Fluent < # Database # > import Vapor extension User : < # Database # > Migration { } Take a look at Fluent \u2192 Migration if you are interested in learning more about custom migrations. Configuring Migrations \u00b6 Once you have created a migration, you must register it to Fluent using MigrationConfig . This is done in configure.swift . Fill in the database ID ( dbid ) from the table above, i.e., psql . import Fluent < # Database # > import Vapor // Configure migrations var migrations = MigrationConfig () migrations . add ( model : User . self , database : . < # dbid # > ) services . register ( migrations ) // Other services.... Tip If the migration you are adding is also a model, you can use the add(model:on:) convenience to automatically set the model's defaultDatabase property. Otherwise, use the add(migration:on) method. Once you have the MigrationConfig added, you should be able to run your application and see the following: Migrating < #dbid#> DB Migrations complete Server starting on http://localhost:8080 Performing a Query \u00b6 router . get ( \"users\" ) { req in return User . query ( on : req ). all () } If you run your app, and query that route, you should see an empty array returned. Now you just need to add some users! Congratulations on getting your first Fluent model working. Raw Queries \u00b6 With Fluent, you always have access to the underlying database driver. Using this underlying driver to perform a query is sometimes called a \"raw query\". To perform raw queries, you need access to a database connection. Vapor's Request type has a number of conveniences for creating new database connections. The recommended method is withPooledConnection(to:) . Learn about other methods in DatabaseKit \u2192 Overview \u2192 Connections . router . get ( \"raw\" ) { req -> Future < String > in return req . withPooledConnection ( to : . < # dbid # > ) { conn in // perform raw query using conn } } Once you have the database connection, you can perform a query on it.

Migrations are often used for preparing a database schema for your models. However, they can also be used to make normal queries to your database. In this guide we will cover creating both types of migrations. Creating and Deleting Schemas \u00b6 Let's take a look at how we can use migrations to prepare a schema supporting database to store a theoretical Galaxy model. Fill in the Xcode placeholders below with your database's name from Getting Started \u2192 Choosing a Driver . import Fluent < # Database # > struct Galaxy : < # Database # > Model { var id : ID ? var name : String } Automatic Model Migrations \u00b6 Models provide a shortcut for declaring database migrations. If you conform a type that conforms to Model to Migration , Fluent can infer the model's properties and automatically implement the prepare(...) and revert(...) methods. import Fluent < # Database # > extension Galaxy : < # Database # > Migration { } This method is especially useful for quick prototyping and simple setups. For most other situations you should consider creating a normal, custom migration. Add this automatic migration to your MigrationConfig using the add(model:database:) method. This is done in configure.swift . var migrations = MigrationConfig () migrations . add ( model : Galaxy . self , database : . < # dbid # > ) services . register ( migrations ) The add(model:database:) method will automatically set the model's defaultDatabase property. Custom Migrations \u00b6 We can customize the table created for our model by creating a migration and using the static create and delete methods on Database . import Fluent < # Database # > struct CreateGalaxy : < # Database # > Migration { // ... } Creating a Schema \u00b6 The most important method in a migration is prepare(...) . This is responsible for effecting the migration's changes. For our CreateGalaxy migration, we will use our database's static create method to create a schema. import Fluent < # Database # > struct CreateGalaxy : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func prepare ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . create ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in builder . field ( for : \\ . id , isIdentifier : true ) builder . field ( for : \\ . name ) } } } To create a schema, you must pass a model type and connection as the first two parameters. The third parameter is a closure that accepts the SchemaBuilder . This builder has convenience methods for declaring fields in the schema. You can use the field(for: <#KeyPath#>) method to quickly create fields for each of your model's properties. Since this method accepts key paths to the model (indicated by \\. ), Fluent can see what type those properties are. For most common types ( String , Int , Double , etc) Fluent will automatically be able to determine the best database field type to use. You can also choose to manually select which database field type to use for a given field. try builder . field ( for : \\ . name , type : < # DataType # > ) Each database has it's own unique data types, so refer to your database's documentation for more information. database docs api docs PostgreSQL PostgreSQL \u2192 Getting Started PostgreSQLDataType MySQL MySQL \u2192 Getting Started MySQLDataType SQLite SQLite \u2192 Getting Started SQLiteDataType Deleting a Schema \u00b6 Each migration should also include a method for reverting the changes it makes. It is used when you boot your app with the --revert option. For a migration that creates a table in the database, the reversion is quite simple: delete the table. To implement revert for our model, we can use our database's static delete(...) method to indicate that we would like to delete the schema. import Fluent < # Database # > struct CreateGalaxy : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func revert ( on connection : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . delete ( Galaxy . self , on : connection ) } } To delete a schema, you pass a model type and connection as the two required parameters. That's it. You can always choose to skip a reversion by simplying returning conn.future(()) . But note that they are especially useful when testing and debugging your migrations. Add this custom migration to your MigrationConfig using the add(migration:database:) method. This is done in your configure.swift file. var migrations = MigrationConfig () migrations . add ( migration : CreateGalaxy . self , database : . < # dbid # > ) services . register ( migrations ) Make sure to also set the defaultDatabase property on your model when using a custom migration. Galaxy . defaultDatabase = . < # dbid # > Updating a Schema \u00b6 After you deploy your application to production, you may find it necessary to add or remove fields on an existing model. You can achieve this by creating a new migration. For this example, let's assume we want to add a new property mass to the Galaxy model from the previous section. import Fluent < # Database # > struct Galaxy : < # Database # > Model { var id : ID ? var name : String var mass : Int } Since our previous migration created a table with fields for both id and name , we need to update that table and add a field for mass . We can do this by using the static update method on Database . import Fluent < # Database # > struct AddGalaxyMass : < # Database # > Migration { // ... } Our prepare method will look very similar to the prepare method for a new table, except it will only contain our newly added field. struct AddGalaxyMass : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func prepare ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . update ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in builder . field ( for : \\ . mass ) } } } Note: In SQLite and maybe other databases that have strict NULL / NOT NULL constraint, you may receive the following error: Cannot add a NOT NULL column with default value NULL Since we declared our mass property non-optional ( Int ), we will have to add a special configuration that declares its default value as well. In SQL, this is equivalent to the DEFAULT keyword. Therefore, to fix the error, the above code would become: struct AddGalaxyMass : SQLiteMigration { // ... static func prepare ( on conn : SQLiteConnection ) -> Future < Void > { return SQLiteDatabase . update ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in let defaultValueConstraint = SQLiteColumnConstraint . default (. literal ( 0 )) builder . field ( for : \\ . mass , type : . integer , defaultValueConstraint ) } } } All methods available when creating a schema will be available while updating alongside some new methods for deleting fields. See SchemaUpdater for a list of all available methods. To revert this change, we must delete the mass field from the table. struct AddGalaxyMass : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func revert ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . update ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in builder . deleteField ( for : \\ . mass ) } } } Add this migration to your MigrationConfig using the add(migration:database:) method. This is done in your configure.swift file. var migrations = MigrationConfig () // ... migrations . add ( migration : AddGalaxyMass . self , database : . < # dbid # > ) services . register ( migrations ) Migrating Data \u00b6 While migrations are useful for creating and updating schemas in SQL databases, they can also be used for more general purposes in any database. Migrations are passed a connection upon running which can be used to perform arbitrary database queries. For this example, let's assume we want to do a data cleanup migration on our Galaxy model and delete any galaxies with a mass of 0 . The first step is to create our new migration type. struct GalaxyMassCleanup : < # Database # > Migration { // ... } In the prepare method of this migration, we will perform a query to delete all galaxies which have a mass equal to 0 . struct GalaxyMassCleanup : < # Database # > Migration { static func prepare ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). filter ( \\ . mass == 0 ). delete () } // ... } There is no way to undo this migration since it is destructive. You can omit the revert(...) method by returning a pre-completed future. struct GalaxyMassCleanup : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func revert ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return conn . future (()) } } Add this migration to your MigrationConfig using the add(migration:database:) method.

This is done in configure.swift . var migrations = MigrationConfig () migrations . add ( model : Galaxy . self , database : . < # dbid # > ) services . register ( migrations ) The add(model:database:) method will automatically set the model's defaultDatabase property.","title":"Automatic Model Migrations"},{"location":"fluent/migrations/#custom-migrations","text":"We can customize the table created for our model by creating a migration and using the static create and delete methods on Database . import Fluent < # Database # > struct CreateGalaxy : < # Database # > Migration { // ... }","title":"Custom Migrations"},{"location":"fluent/migrations/#creating-a-schema","text":"The most important method in a migration is prepare(...) . This is responsible for effecting the migration's changes. For our CreateGalaxy migration, we will use our database's static create method to create a schema. import Fluent < # Database # > struct CreateGalaxy : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func prepare ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . create ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in builder . field ( for : \\ . id , isIdentifier : true ) builder . field ( for : \\ . name ) } } } To create a schema, you must pass a model type and connection as the first two parameters. The third parameter is a closure that accepts the SchemaBuilder . This builder has convenience methods for declaring fields in the schema. You can use the field(for: <#KeyPath#>) method to quickly create fields for each of your model's properties. Since this method accepts key paths to the model (indicated by \\. ), Fluent can see what type those properties are. For most common types ( String , Int , Double , etc) Fluent will automatically be able to determine the best database field type to use. You can also choose to manually select which database field type to use for a given field. try builder . field ( for : \\ . name , type : < # DataType # > ) Each database has it's own unique data types, so refer to your database's documentation for more information. database docs api docs PostgreSQL PostgreSQL \u2192 Getting Started PostgreSQLDataType MySQL MySQL \u2192 Getting Started MySQLDataType SQLite SQLite \u2192 Getting Started SQLiteDataType","title":"Creating a Schema"},{"location":"fluent/migrations/#deleting-a-schema","text":"Each migration should also include a method for reverting the changes it makes. It is used when you boot your app with the --revert option. For a migration that creates a table in the database, the reversion is quite simple: delete the table. To implement revert for our model, we can use our database's static delete(...) method to indicate that we would like to delete the schema. import Fluent < # Database # > struct CreateGalaxy : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func revert ( on connection : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . delete ( Galaxy . self , on : connection ) } } To delete a schema, you pass a model type and connection as the two required parameters. That's it. You can always choose to skip a reversion by simplying returning conn.future(()) . But note that they are especially useful when testing and debugging your migrations. Add this custom migration to your MigrationConfig using the add(migration:database:) method. This is done in your configure.swift file. var migrations = MigrationConfig () migrations . add ( migration : CreateGalaxy . self , database : . < # dbid # > ) services . register ( migrations ) Make sure to also set the defaultDatabase property on your model when using a custom migration.

You can achieve this by creating a new migration. For this example, let's assume we want to add a new property mass to the Galaxy model from the previous section. import Fluent < # Database # > struct Galaxy : < # Database # > Model { var id : ID ? var name : String var mass : Int } Since our previous migration created a table with fields for both id and name , we need to update that table and add a field for mass . We can do this by using the static update method on Database . import Fluent < # Database # > struct AddGalaxyMass : < # Database # > Migration { // ... } Our prepare method will look very similar to the prepare method for a new table, except it will only contain our newly added field. struct AddGalaxyMass : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func prepare ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . update ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in builder . field ( for : \\ . mass ) } } } Note: In SQLite and maybe other databases that have strict NULL / NOT NULL constraint, you may receive the following error: Cannot add a NOT NULL column with default value NULL Since we declared our mass property non-optional ( Int ), we will have to add a special configuration that declares its default value as well. In SQL, this is equivalent to the DEFAULT keyword. Therefore, to fix the error, the above code would become: struct AddGalaxyMass : SQLiteMigration { // ... static func prepare ( on conn : SQLiteConnection ) -> Future < Void > { return SQLiteDatabase . update ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in let defaultValueConstraint = SQLiteColumnConstraint . default (. literal ( 0 )) builder . field ( for : \\ . mass , type : . integer , defaultValueConstraint ) } } } All methods available when creating a schema will be available while updating alongside some new methods for deleting fields. See SchemaUpdater for a list of all available methods. To revert this change, we must delete the mass field from the table. struct AddGalaxyMass : < # Database # > Migration { // ... static func revert ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return < # Database # > Database . update ( Galaxy . self , on : conn ) { builder in builder . deleteField ( for : \\ . mass ) } } } Add this migration to your MigrationConfig using the add(migration:database:) method.

The first step is to create our new migration type. struct GalaxyMassCleanup : < # Database # > Migration { // ... } In the prepare method of this migration, we will perform a query to delete all galaxies which have a mass equal to 0 . struct GalaxyMassCleanup : < # Database # > Migration { static func prepare ( on conn : < # Database # > Connection ) -> Future < Void > { return Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). filter ( \\ . mass == 0 ). delete () } // ... } There is no way to undo this migration since it is destructive.

Unlike ORMs in other languages, Fluent doesn't return untyped arrays or dictionaries for queries. Instead, you query the database using models. This allows the Swift compiler to catch many errors that have burdened ORM users for ages. Info This guide provides an overview of the Model protocol and its associated methods and properties. If you are just getting started, check out the guide for your database at Fluent \u2192 Getting Started . Model is a protocol in the Fluent module. It extends the AnyModel protocol which can be used for type-erasure. Conformance \u00b6 Both struct s and class es can conform to Model , however you must pay special attention to Fluent's return types if you use a struct . Since Fluent works asynchronously, any mutations to a value-type ( struct ) model must return a new copy of the model as a future result. Normally, you will conform your model to one of the convenience models available in your database-specific package (i.e., PostgreSQLModel ). However, if you want to customize additional properties, such as the model's idKey , you will want to use the Model protocol itself. Let's take a look at what a basic Model conformance looks like. /// A simple user. final class User : Model { /// See `Model.Database` typealias Database = FooDatabase /// See `Model.ID` typealias ID = Int /// See `Model.idKey` static let idKey : IDKey = \\ . id /// The unique identifier for this user. var id : Int ? /// The user's full name. var name : String /// The user's current age in years. var age : Int /// Creates a new user. init ( id : Int ? = nil , name : String , age : Int ) { self . id = id self . name = name self . age = age } } Tip Using final prevents your class from being sub-classed. This makes your life easier. Associated Types \u00b6 Model defines a few associated types that help Fluent create type-safe APIs for you to use. Take a look at AnyModel if you need a type-erased version with no associated types. Database \u00b6 This type indicates to Fluent which database you intend to use with this model. Using this information, Fluent can dynamically add appropriate methods and data types to any QueryBuilder s you create with this model. final class User : Model { /// See `Model.Database` typealias Database = FooDatabase /// ... } It is possible to make this associated type generic by adding a generic type to your class or struct (i.e, User<T> ). This is useful for cases where you are attempting to create generic extensions to Fluent, like perhaps an additive service provider. final class User < D >: Model where D : Database { /// See `Model.Database` typealias Database = D /// ... } You can add further conditions to D , such as QuerySupporting or SchemaSupporting . You can also dynamically extend and conform your generic model using extension User where D: ... { } . That said, for most cases, you should stick to using a concrete type-alias wherever possible. Fluent 3 is designed to allow you to harness the power of your database by creating a strong connection between your models and the underlying driver. ID \u00b6 This property defines the type your model will use for its unique identifier. final class User : Model { /// See `Model.ID` typealias ID = UUID /// ... } This will usually be something like Int , UUID , or String although you can theoretically use any type you like. Properties \u00b6 There are several overridable properties on Model that you can use to customize how Fluent interacts with your database. Name \u00b6 This String will be used as a unique identifier for your model whenever Fluent needs one. final class User : Model { /// See `Model.name` static let name = \"user\" /// ... } By default, this is the type name of your model. Entity \u00b6 Entity is a generic word used to mean either \"table\" or \"collection\", depending on which type of backend you are using for Fluent. final class Goose : Model { /// See `Model.entity` static let entity = \"geese\" /// ... } By default, this property will be name . ID Key \u00b6 The ID key is a writeable key path that points to your model's unique identifier property. Usually this will be a property named id (for some databases it is _id ). However you can theoretically use any key you like. final class User : Model { /// See `Model.ID` typealias ID = String /// See `Model.entity` static let idKey = \\ . username /// The user's unique username var username : String ? /// ... } The idKey property must point to an optional, writeable ( var ) property with type matching ID . Lifecycle \u00b6 There are several lifecycle methods on Model that you can override to hook into Fluent events. method description throwing willCreate Called before Fluent saves your model (for the first time) Cancels the save. didCreate Called after Fluent saves your model (for the first time) Save completes. Query fails. willUpdate Called before Fluent saves your model (subsequent saves) Cancels the save. didUpdate Called after Fluent saves your model (subsequent saves) Save completes. Query fails. willRead Called before Fluent returns your model from a fetch query. Cancels the fetch. willDelete Called before Fluent deletes your model. Cancels the delete.

No async work is being done, so we must create a future manually. return Future . map ( on : connection ) { self } } } CRUD \u00b6 The model offers basic CRUD method (create, read, update, delete). Create \u00b6 This method creates a new row / item for an instance of your model in the database.

Connection \u00b6 The first thing you need to query your database, is a connection to it. Luckily, they are easy to get. Request \u00b6 The easiest way to connect to your database is simply using the incoming Request . This will use the model's defaultDatabase property to automatically fetch a pooled connection to the database. router . get ( \"galaxies\" ) { req in return Galaxy . query ( on : req ). all () } You can use convenience methods on a Container to create connections manually. Learn more about that in DatabaseKit \u2192 Overview \u2192 Connections . Create \u00b6 One of the first things you will need to do is save some data to your database. You do this by initializing an instance of your model then calling create(on:) . router . post ( \"galaxies\" ) { req in let galaxy : Galaxy = ... return galaxy . create ( on : req ) } The create method will return the saved model. The returned model will include any generated fields such as the ID or fields with default values. If your model also conforms to Content you can return the result of the Fluent query directly. Read \u00b6 To read models from the database, you can use query(on:) or find(_:on:) . Find \u00b6 The easiest way to find a single model is by passing its ID to find(_:on:) . Galaxy . find ( 42 , on : conn ) The result will be a future containing an optional value. You can use unwrap(or:) to unwrap the future value or throw an error. Galaxy . find ( 42 , on : conn ). unwrap ( or : Abort (...)) Query \u00b6 You can use the query(on:) method to build database queries with filters, joins, sorts, and more. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). filter ( \\ . name == \"Milky Way\" ) Filter \u00b6 The filter(_:) method accepts filters created from Fluent's operators. This provides a concise, Swifty way for building Fluent queries. Calls to filter can be chained and even grouped. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). filter ( \\ . mass >= 500 ). filter ( \\ . type == . spiral ) Below is a list of all supported operators. operator type == Equal != Not equal > Greater than < Less than >= Greater than or equal <= Less than or equal By default, all chained filters will be used to limit the result set. You can use filter groups to change this behavior. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). group (. or ) { $0 . filter ( \\ . mass <= 250 ). filter ( \\ . mass >= 500 ) }. filter ( \\ . type == . spiral ) The above query will include results where the galaxy's mass is below 250 or above 500 and the type is spiral. Range \u00b6 You can apply Swift ranges to a query builder to limit the result set. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). range (..< 50 ) The above query will include only the first 50 results. For more information on ranges, see docs for Swift's Range type. Sort \u00b6 Query results can be sorted by a given field. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). sort ( \\ . name , . descending ) You can sort by multiple fields to perform tie breaking behavior where there is duplicate information in the one of the sorted fields. Join \u00b6 Other models can be joined to an existing query in order to further filter the results. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). join ( \\ Planet . galaxyID , to : \\ Galaxy . id ) . filter ( \\ Planet . name == \"Earth\" ) Once a table has been joined using join(_:to:) , you can use fully-qualified key paths to filter results based on data in the joined table. The above query fetches all galaxies that have a planet named Earth. You can even decode the joined models using alsoDecode(...) . Galaxy . query ( on : conn ) // join Planet and filter . alsoDecode ( Planet . self ). all () The above query will decode an array of (Galaxy, Planet) tuples. Fetch \u00b6 To fetch the results of a query, use all() , chunk(max:closure:) , first() or an aggregate method. All \u00b6 The most common method for fetching results is with all() .

Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). all () When combined with range(_:) , you can efficiently limit how many results are returned by the database. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). range (..< 50 ). all () Chunk \u00b6 For situations where memory conservation is important, use chunk(...) . This method returns the result set in multiple calls of a maximum chunk size. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). chunk ( max : 32 ) { galaxies in print ( galaxies ) // Array of 32 or less galaxies } First \u00b6 The first() method is a convenience for fetching the first result of a query. It will automatically apply a range restriction to avoid transferring unnecessary data. Galaxy . query ( on : conn ). filter ( \\ . name == \"Milky Way\" ). first () This method is more efficient than calling all and getting the first item in the array.

These relations help make working with a normalized data structure easy. Parent-Child \u00b6 The most common model relation is the one-to-many or parent-child relation. In this relation, each child model stores at most one identifier of a parent model. In most cases, multiple child models can store the same parent identifier at the same time. This means that any given parent can have zero or more related child models. Hence the name, one (parent) to many (children). Note If each child must store a unique parent ID, this relation is called a one-to-one relation. Take a look at the following diagram in which an example parent-child relation between two models ( Galaxy and Planet ) is shown. In the example above, Galaxy is the parent and Planet is the child. Planets store an identifier referencing exactly one galaxy (the galaxy they are in). In turn, each galaxy has zero or more planets that belong to it. Let's take a look at what these models would look like in Fluent. struct Galaxy : Model { // ... var id : Int ? var name : String } struct Planet : Model { // ... var id : Int ? var name : String var galaxyID : Int } For more information on defining models see Fluent \u2192 Models . Fluent provides two helpers for working with parent-child relations: Parent and Children . These helpers can be created using extensions on the related models for convenient access. extension Galaxy { // this galaxy's related planets var planets : Children < Galaxy , Planet > { return children ( \\ . galaxyID ) } } Here the children(_:) method is used on Galaxy to create the relation. The resulting type has two generic arguments in the signature that can be thought of as <From, To >. Since this relation goes from galaxy to planet, they are ordered as such in the generic arguments. Note that this method is not static. That is because it must access the galaxy's identifier to perform the relation lookup. extension Planet { // this planet's related galaxy var galaxy : Parent < Planet , Galaxy > { return parent ( \\ . galaxyID ) } } Here the parent(_:) method is used on Planet to create the inverse relation. The resulting type also has two generic arguments. In this case, they are reversed since this relation now goes from planet to galaxy. Note that this method is also not static. That is because it must access the referenced identifier to perform the relation lookup. Now that the models and relation properties are created, they can be used to create, read, update, and delete related data. let galaxy : Galaxy = ... let planets = galaxy . planets . query ( on : ...). all () The query(on:) method on a relation creates an instance of QueryBuilder filtered to the related models. See Fluent \u2192 Querying for more information on working with the query builder. let planet : Planet = ... let galaxy = planet . galaxy . get ( on : ...) Since the child can have at most one parent, the most useful method is [ get(on:) ] which simply returns the parent model. Siblings \u00b6 A more powerful (and complex) relation is the many-to-many or siblings relation. In this relation, two models are related by a third model called a pivot . The pivot is a simple model that carries one identifier for each of the two related models. Because a third model (the pivot) stores identifiers, each model can be related to zero or more models on the other side of the relation. Take a look at the following diagram in which an example siblings relation between two models ( Planet and Tag ) and a pivot ( PlanetTag ) is shown. A siblings relation is required for the above example because: Both Earth and Venus have the Earth Sized tag. Earth has both the Earth Sized and Liquid Water tag. In other words, two planets can share one tag and two tags can share one planet. This is a many-to-many relation. Let's take a look at what these models would look like in Fluent. struct Planet : Model { // ... var id : Int ? var name : String var galaxyID : Int } struct Tag : Model { // ... var id : Int ? var name : String } For more information on defining models see Fluent \u2192 Models . Now let's take a look at the pivot. It may seem a bit intimidating at first, but it's really quite simple. struct PlanetTag : Pivot { // ... typealias Left = Planet typealias Right = Tag static var leftIDKey : LeftIDKey = \\ . planetID static var rightIDKey : RightIDKey = \\ . tagID var id : Int ? var planetID : Int var tagID : Int } A pivot must have Left and Right model types. In this case, those model types are Planet and Tag . Although it is arbitrary which model is left vs. right, a good rule of thumb is to order things alphabetically for consistency. Once the left and right models are defined, we must supply Fluent with key paths to the stored properties for each ID. We can use the LeftIDKey and RightIDKey type-aliases to do this. A Pivot is also a Model itself. You are free to store any additional properties here if you like. Don't forget to create a migration for it if you are using a database that supports schemas. Once the pivot and your models are created, you can add convenience extensions for interacting with the relation just like the parent-child relation. extension Planet { // this planet's related tags var tags : Siblings < Planet , Tag , PlanetTag > { return siblings () } } Because the siblings relation requires three models, it has three generic arguments. You can think of the arguments as <From, To, Through> . This relation goes from a planet to tags through the planet tag pivot. The other side of the relation (on tag) is similar. Only the first two generic arguments are flipped. extension Tag { // all planets that have this tag var planets : Siblings < Tag , Planet , PlanetTag > { return siblings () } } Now that the relations are setup, we can query a planet's tags. This works just like the Children type in the parent-child relationship. let planet : Planet = ... planet . tags . query ( on : ...). all () Modifiable Pivot \u00b6 If the pivot conforms to ModifiablePivot , then Fluent can help to create and delete pivots (called attaching and detaching). Conforming a pivot is fairly simple. Fluent just needs to be able to initialize the pivot from two related models. extension PlanetTag : ModifiablePivot { init ( _ planet : Planet , _ tag : Tag ) throws { planetID = try planet . requireID () tagID = try tag . requireID () } } Once the pivot type conforms, there will be extra methods available on the siblings relation. let planet : Planet = ... let tag : Tag = ... planet . tags . attach ( tag , on : ...)","title":"Relations"},{"location":"fluent/relations/#fluent-relations","text":"Fluent supports two methods for relating models: one-to-many (parent-child) and many-to-many (siblings).

If this is your first time hearing about futures, they might seem a little confusing at first. But don't worry, Vapor makes them easy to use. This guide will give you a quick introduction to working with Async. Check out Async \u2192 Overview for more information. Futures \u00b6 Since Future s work asynchronously, we must use closures to interact with and transform their values. Just like optionals in Swift, futures can be mapped and flat-mapped.

It gets the name \"flat\" map because it is what allows you to avoid creating nested futures (e.g., Future<Future<T>> ). In other words, it helps you keep your futures flat. /// Assume we get a future string back from some API let futureString : Future < String > = ... /// Assume we have created an HTTP client let client : Client = ... /// Flat-map the future string to a future response let futureResponse = futureString . flatMap ( to : Response . self ) { string in return client . get ( string ) // Future<Response> } /// We now have a future response print ( futureResponse ) // Future<Response> Info If we instead used .map(to:_:) in the above example, we would have ended up with a Future<Future<Response>> .

The services framework allows you to register, configure, and initialize anything you might need in your application. Container \u00b6 Most of your interaction with services will happen through a container. A container is a combination of the following: Services : A collection of registered services. Config : Declared preferences for certain services over others. Environment : The application's current environment type (testing, production, etc) Worker : The event loop associated with this container. The most common containers you will interact with in Vapor are: Application Request Response You should use the Application as a container to create services required for booting your app. You should use the Request or Response containers to create services for responding to requests (in route closures and controllers). Make \u00b6 Making services is simple, just call .make(_:) on a container and pass the type you want, usually a protocol like Client . let client = try req . make ( Client . self ) You can also specify a concrete type if you know exactly what you want. let leaf = try req . make ( LeafRenderer . self ) print ( leaf ) /// Definitely a LeafRenderer let view = try req . make ( ViewRenderer . self ) print ( view ) /// ViewRenderer, might be a LeafRenderer Tip Try to rely on protocols over concrete types if you can. This will make testing your code easier (you can easily swap in dummy implementations) and it can help keep your code decoupled. Services \u00b6 The Services struct contains all of the services you\u2014or the service providers you have added\u2014have registered. You will usually register and configure your services in configure.swift . Instance \u00b6 You can register initialized service instances using .register(_:) . /// Create an in-memory SQLite database let sqlite = SQLiteDatabase ( storage : . memory ) /// Register to sevices. services . register ( sqlite ) After you register a service, it will be available for creation by a Container . let db = app . make ( SQLiteDatabase . self ) print ( db ) // SQLiteDatabase (the one we registered earlier) Protocol \u00b6 When registering services, you can also declare conformance to a particular protocol. You might have noticed that this is how Vapor registers its main router. /// Register routes to the router let router = EngineRouter . default () try routes ( router ) services . register ( router , as : Router . self ) Since we register the router variable with as: Router.self , it can be created using either the concrete type or the protocol. let router = app . make ( Router . self ) let engineRouter = app . make ( EngineRouter . self ) print ( router ) // Router (actually EngineRouter) print ( engineRouter ) // EngineRouter print ( router === engineRouter ) // true Environment \u00b6 The environment is used to dynamically change how your Vapor app behaves in certain situations. For example, you probably want to use a different username and password for your database when your application is deployed. The Environment type makes managing this easy. When you run your Vapor app from the command line, you can pass an optional --env flag to specify the environment. By default, the environment will be .development . swift run Run --env prod In the above example, we are running Vapor in the .production environment. This environment specifies isRelease = true . You can use the environment passed into configure.swift to dynamically register services. let sqlite : SQLiteDatabase if env . isRelease { /// Create file-based SQLite db using $SQLITE_PATH from process env sqlite = try SQLiteDatabase ( storage : . file ( path : Environment . get ( \"SQLITE_PATH\" ) ! )) } else { /// Create an in-memory SQLite database sqlite = try SQLiteDatabase ( storage : . memory ) } services . register ( sqlite ) Info Use the static method Environment.get(_:) to fetch string values from the process environment.

Tip Learn more about SPM on Swift.org \u2192 Package Manifest \u00b6 The first place SPM looks in your project is the package manifest. This should always be located in the root directory of your project and named Package.swift . Dependencies \u00b6 Dependencies are other SPM packages that your package relies on. All Vapor applications rely on the Vapor package, but you can add as many other dependencies as you want. // swift-tools-version:4.0 import PackageDescription let package = Package ( name : \"VaporApp\" , dependencies : [ // \ud83d\udca7 A server-side Swift web framework. . package ( url : \"https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git\" , from : \"3.0.0\" ), ], targets : [ ... ] ) In the above example, you can see vapor/vapor \u2192 version 3.0 or later is a dependency of this package. When you add a dependency to your package, you must next signal which targets depend on the newly available modules. Warning Anytime you modify the package manifest, call vapor update to effect the changes. Targets \u00b6 Targets are all of the modules, executables, and tests that your package contains. // swift-tools-version:4.0 import PackageDescription let package = Package ( name : \"VaporApp\" , dependencies : [ ... ], targets : [ . target ( name : \"App\" , dependencies : [ \"Vapor\" ]), . target ( name : \"Run\" , dependencies : [ \"App\" ]), . testTarget ( name : \"AppTests\" , dependencies : [ \"App\" ]), ] ) Most Vapor apps will have three targets, although you can add as many as you like to organize your code. Each target declares which modules it depends on. You must add module names here in order to import them in your code. A target can depend on other targets in your project or any modules exposed by packages you've added to the main dependencies array. Tip Executable targets (targets that contain a main.swift file) cannot be imported by other modules. This is why Vapor has both an App and a Run target.

Public \u00b6 This folder contains any public files that will be served by your app. This is usually images, style sheets, and browser scripts. Whenever Vapor responds to a request, it will first check if the requested item is in this folder. If it is, it skips your application logic and returns the file immediately. For example, a request to localhost:8080/favicon.ico will check to see if Public/favicon.ico exists. If it does, Vapor will return it. Sources \u00b6 This folder contains all of the Swift source files for your project. The top level folders ( App and Run ) reflect your package's modules, as declared in the package manifest . App \u00b6 This is the most important folder in your application, it's where all of the application logic goes! Controllers \u00b6 Controllers are great way of grouping together application logic. Most controllers have many functions that accept a request and return some sort of response. Tip Vapor supports, but does not enforce the MVC pattern Models \u00b6 The Models folder is a great place to store your Content structs or Fluent Model s. boot.swift \u00b6 This file contains a function that will be called after your application has booted, but before it has started running. This is a great place do things that should happen every time your application starts. You have access to the Application here which you can use to create any services you might need. configure.swift \u00b6 This file contains a function that receives the config, environment, and services for your application as input. This is a great place to make changes to your config or register services to your application. routes.swift \u00b6 This file contains a function for adding routes to your router. You will notice there's one example route in there that returns the \"hello, world\" response we saw earlier. You can create as many methods as you want to further organize your code. Just make sure to call them in this main route collection. Tests \u00b6 Each non-executable module in your Sources folder should have a corresponding ...Tests folder.

For the most part they are very similar, but there are a couple of differences. Request \u00b6 HTTP requests are sent by clients to a server and they should always receive exactly one HTTP response. HTTP requests contain two unique fields over a standard HTTP message: method url The method and URL define what content on the server is being requested. /// GET /hello let httpReq = HTTPRequest ( method : . GET , url : \"/hello\" ) You can define these when initializing an HTTP request, or set them later if the request is mutable. var httpReq : HTTPRequest = ... httpReq . method = . POST httpReq . url = URL (...) You can use Foundation's URLComponents to create URL s from their base components. HTTP request also has a property urlString that you can use to set a custom URL String manually, without going through URL . Here is what a serialized HTTP request looks like. This one is querying /hello . GET /hello HTTP / 1.1 Content-Length : 0 Response \u00b6 HTTP responses are generated by servers in response to an HTTP request. HTTP response only has one unique field over general HTTP messages: status The HTTP status is used to inform the client of any errors. The status consists of a status code and a reason. The code is always a three digit number and the reason is a short string explaining the code. You can see all of the status codes on httpstatuses.com . let httpRes = HTTPResponse ( status : . ok , body : \"hello\" ) All of the commonly used HTTP statuses will have pre-defined values you can use, like .ok for 200 OK . You can also define your own custom status codes.

HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Length : 5 Content-Type : text/plain hello Headers \u00b6 Every HTTP message has a collection of headers. Headers contain metadata about the message and help to explain what is in the message's body. Content-Length: 5 Content-Type: text/plain There must be at least a \"Content-Length\" or \"Transfer-Encoding\" header to define how long the message's body is. There is almost always a \"Content-Type\" header that explains what type of data the body contains. There are many other common headers such as \"Date\" which specifies when the message was created, and more. You can access an HTTP message's headers using the headers property. var message : HTTPMessage ... message . headers . firstValue ( for : . contentLength ) // 5 If you are interacting with common HTTP headers, you can use the convenience HTTP names instead of a raw String . Body \u00b6 HTTP messages can have an HTTPBody containing arbitrary data. This data can be either static or streaming and can be in whatever format you want.

Once you are finished configuring your app to use the JWT package (see JWT \u2192 Getting Started ), you are ready to begin using JWTs in your app. Structure \u00b6 Like other forms of token-based auth, JWTs are sent using the bearer authorization header. GET /hello HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Bearer <token> ... In the example HTTP request above, <token> would be replaced by the serialized JWT. jwt.io hosts an online tool for parsing and serializing JWTs. We will use that tool to create a token for testing. Header \u00b6 The header is mainly used to specify which algorithm was used to generate the token's signature. This is used by the accepting app to verify the token's authenticity. Here is the raw JSON data for our header: { \"alg\" : \"HS256\" , \"typ\" : \"JWT\" } This specifies the HMAC SHA-256 signing algorithm and that our token is indeed a JWT. Payload \u00b6 The payload is where you store information to identify the authenticated user. You can store any data you want here, but be careful not to store too much as some web browsers limit HTTP header sizes. The payload is also where you store claims . Claims are standardized key / value pairs that many JWT implementations can recognize and act on automatically. A commonly used claim is Expiration Time which stores the token's expiration date as a unix timestamp at key \"exp\" . See a full list of supported claims in RFC 7519 \u00a7 4.1 . To keep things simple, we will just include our user's identifier and name in the payload: { \"id\" : 42 , \"name\" : \"Vapor Developer\" } Secret \u00b6 Last but not least is the secret key used to sign and verify the JWT. For this example, we are using the HS256 algorithm (specified in the JWT header). HMAC algorithms use a single secret key for both signing and verifying. To keep things simple, we will use the following string as our key: secret Other algorithms, like RSA, use asymmetric (public and private) keys. With these types of algorithms, only the private key is able to create (sign) JWTs. Both the public and private keys can verify JWTs. This allows for an added layer of security as you can distribute the public key to services that should only be able to verify tokens, not create them. Serialized \u00b6 Finally, here is our fully serialized token. This will be sent via the bearer authorization header. eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6NDIsIm5hbWUiOiJWYXBvciBEZXZlbG9wZXIifQ.__Dm_tr1Ky2VYhZNoN6XpEkaRHjtRgaM6HdgDFcc9PM Each segment is separated by a . . The overall structure of the token is the following: <header>.<payload>.<signature> Note that the header and payload segments are simply base64-url encoded JSON. It is important to remember that all information your store in a normal JWT is publically readable. Parse \u00b6 Let's take a look at how to parse and verify incoming JWTs. Payload \u00b6 First, we need to create a Codable type that represents our payload. This should also conform to JWTPayload . struct User : JWTPayload { var id : Int var name : String func verify ( using signer : JWTSigner ) throws { // nothing to verify } } Since our simple payload does not include any claims, we can leave the verify(using:) method empty for now. Route \u00b6 Now that our payload type is ready, we can parse and verify an incoming JWT. import JWT import Vapor router . get ( \"hello\" ) { req -> String in // fetches the token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header guard let bearer = req . http . headers . bearerAuthorization else { throw Abort (. unauthorized ) } // parse JWT from token string, using HS-256 signer let jwt = try JWT < User >( from : bearer . token , verifiedUsing : . hs256 ( key : \"secret\" )) return \"Hello, \\( jwt . payload . name ) !\" } This snippet creates a new route at GET /hello . The first part of the route handler fetches the <token> value from the bearer authorization header. The second part uses the JWT struct to parse the token using an HS256 signer. Once the JWT is parsed, we access the payload property which contains an instance of our User type. We then access the name property to say hello!

You can use it to generate dynamic HTML pages for a front-end website or generate rich emails to send from an API. This guide will give you an overview of Leaf's syntax and the available tags. Template syntax \u00b6 Here is an example of a basic Leaf tag usage. There are #count ( users) users. Leaf tags are made up of four elements: Token # : This signals the leaf parser to begin looking for a tag. Name count : that identifies the tag. Parameter List (users) : May accept zero or more arguments. Body: An optional body can be supplied to some tags. This is similar to Swift's trailing-closure syntax. There can be many different usages of these four elements depending on the tag's implementation. Let's look at a few examples of how Leaf's built-in tags might be used: # ( variable) #embed ( \"template\" ) #set ( \"title\" ) { Welcome to Vapor } #count ( friends) #for ( friend in friends) { <li> # ( friend . name) </li> } Leaf also supports many expressions you are familiar with in Swift. + > == || etc. #if ( 1 + 1 == 2 ) { Hello! } Context \u00b6 In the example from Getting Started , we used a [String: String] dictionary to pass data to Leaf. However, you can pass anything that conforms to Encodable . It's actually preferred to use Encodable structs since [String: Any] is not supported. struct WelcomeContext : Encodable { var title : String var number : Int } return try req . view (). make ( \"home\" , WelcomeContext ( title : \"Hello!\" , number : 42 )) That will expose title and message to our Leaf template, which can then be used inside tags. For example: <h1> # ( title) </h1> <p> # ( number) </p> Usage \u00b6 Here are some common Leaf usage examples. Conditions \u00b6 Leaf is able to evaluate a range of conditions using its #if tag. For example, if you provide a variable it will check that variable exists in its context: #if ( title) { The title is # ( title) } else { No title was provided. } You can also write comparisons, for example: #if ( title == \"Welcome\" ) { This is a friendly web page. } else { No strangers allowed! } If you want to use another tag as part of your condition, you should omit the # for the inner tag. For example: #if ( lowercase (title) == \"welcome\" ) { This is a friendly web page. } else { No strangers allowed! } Just like in Swift, you can also use else if statement.s #if ( title == \"Welcome\" ) { This is a friendly web page. } else if ( 1 == 2 ) { What? } else { No strangers allowed! } Loops \u00b6 If you provide an array of items, Leaf can loop over them and let you manipulate each item individually using its #for tag. For example, we could update our Swift code to provide a list of planets: struct SolarSystem : Codable { let planets = [ \"Venus\" , \"Earth\" , \"Mars\" ] } return try req . view (). render (..., SolarSystem ()) We could then loop over them in Leaf like this: Planets: <ul> #for ( planet in planets) { <li> # ( planet) </li> } </ul> This would render a view that looks like: Planets: - Venus - Earth - Mars Leaf provides some extra variables inside a #for loop to give you more information about the loop's progress: The isFirst variable is true when the current iteration is the first one. The isLast variable is true when it's the last iteration. The index variable will be set to the number of the current iteration, counting from 0. Here's how we could use a loop variable to print just the first name in our array: #for ( planet in planets) { #if ( isFirst) { # ( planet) is first! } } Embedding templates \u00b6 Leaf\u2019s #embed tag allows you to copy the contents of one template into another. When use this, you should always omit the template file's .leaf extension. Embedding is useful for copying in a standard piece of content, for example a page footer or advert code: #embed ( \"footer\" ) This tag is also useful for building one template on top of another. For example, you might have a master.leaf file that includes all the code required to lay out your website \u2013 HTML structure, CSS and JavaScript \u2013 with some gaps in place that represent where page content varies. Using this approach, you would construct a child template that fills in its unique content, then embeds the parent template that places the content appropriately. To do this, you can use the #set and #get tags to store and later retrieve content from the context. For example, you might create a child.leaf template like this: #set ( \"body\" ) { <p>Welcome to Vapor!</p> } #embed ( \"master\" ) This stores some HTML in the context as body using #set . We then embed master.leaf which will render body along with any other context variables passed in from Swift. For example, master.leaf might look like this: <html> <head> <title> # ( title) </title> </head> <body> #get ( body) </body> </html> Here we are using #get to fetch the content previously stored in the context. When passed [\"title\": \"Hi there!\"] from Swift, child.leaf will render as follows: < html > < head > < title > Hi there! </ title > </ head > < body >< p > Welcome to Vapor! </ p ></ body > </ html > Comments \u00b6 You can write single or multiline comments with Leaf. They will be discarded when rendering the view. #// Say hello to the user Hello, # ( name) ! Multi-line comments are opened with #/* and closed with */ . #/* Say hello to the user */ Hello, # ( name) ! Other tags \u00b6 #date \u00b6 The #date tag formats dates into a readable string. render (..., [ \"now\" : Date ()]) The time is #date ( now) You can pass a custom date formatter string as the second argument. See Swift's DateFormatter for more information. The date is #date ( now, \"yyyy-MM-dd\" ) #capitalize \u00b6 The #capitalize tag uppercases the first letter of any string. #capitalize ( name) #contains \u00b6 The #contains tag accepts an array and a value as its two parameters, and returns true if the array in parameter one contains the value in parameter two. #if ( contains (planets, \"Earth\" )) { Earth is here! } else { Earth is not in this array. } #count \u00b6 The #count tag returns the number of items in an array. For example: Your search matched #count ( matches) pages. #lowercase \u00b6 The #lowercase tag lowercases all letters in a string. #lowercase ( name) #uppercase \u00b6 The #uppercase tag uppercases all letters in a string. #uppercase ( name)","title":"Overview"},{"location":"leaf/overview/#leaf-overview","text":"Leaf is a powerful templating language with Swift-inspired syntax.

It's most often used for serializing web forms, especially ones that contain rich media like images. It allows for arbitrary data to be encoded in each part thanks to a unique delimiter boundary that is defined separately. This boundary is guaranteed by the client to not appear anywhere in the data. Multipart is a powerful encoding, however it is rarely used in its base format. Most commonly, multipart/form-data is used. This encoding adds a \"name\" property to each part of the multipart data. This is required for serializing web forms. For the rest of this guide, assume we are talking about multipart/form-data unless otherwise specified. Tip Multipart integrates with Content like all other encoding methods in Vapor. See Vapor \u2192 Content for more information about the Content protocol. Let's take a look at how to decode a multipart/form-data -encoded request. Decode \u00b6 Most often, you will be decoding multipart/form-data -encoded requests from a web form. Let's take a look at what one of these requests might look like. After that, we will take a look at what the HTML form for that request would look like. Request \u00b6 Here is an example multipart/form-data -encoded request for creating a new user. POST /users HTTP / 1.1 Content-Type : multipart/form-data; boundary=123 --123 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"name\" Vapor --123 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"age\" 3 --123 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image\"; filename=\"droplet.png\" <contents of image> --123 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"isAdmin\" false --123-- You can see the multipart data uses a boundary (in this case it is \"123\" ) to separate the data. This will usually be a longer string. The client sending a multipart-encoded request must ensure that the boundary it supplies does not appear anywhere in the content it is sending you. That's what allows this encoding to be used to send things like files. Form \u00b6 There are many ways to create a multipart-encoded request, but the most common is an HTML web form. Here is what the HTML form for this request might have looked like. < form method = \"POST\" action = \"/users\" enctype = \"multipart/form-data\" > < input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" > < input type = \"text\" name = \"age\" > < input type = \"file\" name = \"image\" > </ form > Take note of the enctype attribute on the <form> as well as the file type input. This is what allows us to send files via the web form. Content \u00b6 Now let's take a look at how we would handle this request in Vapor. The first step (as always with Content ) is to create a Codable struct that represents the data structure. import Vapor struct User : Content { var name : String var age : Int var image : Data var isAdmin : Bool } Tip You can use File instead of Data if you would also like to access the filename. Now that we have our User struct, let's decode that request! We can use the ContentContainer to do this easily. router . post ( \"users\" ) { req -> Future < HTTPStatus > in return try req . content . decode ( User . self ). map ( to : HTTPStatus . self ) { user in print ( user . name ) // \"Vapor\" print ( user . age ) // 3 print ( user . image ) // Raw image data print ( user . isAdmin ) return . ok } } Now when you post the form to /users , you should see the information printed in the console. Nice work! Encode \u00b6 APIs encode multipart data much less often than they decode it. However, encoding is just as easy with Vapor. Using our same User struct from the previous example, here is how we can encode a multipart-encoded response. router . get ( \"multipart\" ) { req -> User in let res = req . makeResponse () let user = User ( name : \"Vapor\" , age : 3 , image : Data (...), isAdmin : false ) res . content . encode ( user , as : . formData ) return user } Tip If you set a default MediaType on your Content types, then you can return them directly in the route closure.

The higher-level, Fluent ORM guide is located at Fluent \u2192 Getting Started . Using just the MySQL package directly for your project may be a good idea if any of the following are true: You have an existing DB with non-standard structure. You rely heavily on custom or complex SQL queries. You just plain don't like ORMs. MySQL core extends DatabaseKit which provides some conveniences like connection pooling and integrations with Vapor's Services architecture. Tip Even if you do choose to use Fluent MySQL , all of the features of MySQL core will be available to you. Getting Started \u00b6 Let's take a look at how you can get started using MySQL core. Package \u00b6 The first step to using MySQL core is adding it as a dependency to your project in your SPM package manifest file. // swift-tools-version:4.0 import PackageDescription let package = Package ( name : \"MyApp\" , dependencies : [ /// Any other dependencies ... // \ud83d\udc2c Pure Swift MySQL client built on non-blocking, event-driven sockets. . package ( url : \"https://github.com/vapor/mysql.git\" , from : \"3.0.0\" ), ], targets : [ . target ( name : \"App\" , dependencies : [ \"MySQL\" , ...]), . target ( name : \"Run\" , dependencies : [ \"App\" ]), . testTarget ( name : \"AppTests\" , dependencies : [ \"App\" ]), ] ) Don't forget to add the module as a dependency in the targets array. Once you have added the dependency, regenerate your Xcode project with the following command: vapor xcode Config \u00b6 The next step is to configure the database in configure.swift . import MySQL /// Register providers first try services . register ( MySQLProvider ()) Registering the provider will add all of the services required for MySQL to work properly. It also includes a default database config struct that uses standard credentials. Customizing Config \u00b6 You can of course override the default configuration provided by MySQLProvider if you'd like.

Redis Commands \u00b6 Let's take a look at how to send and recieve data using Redis commands. Connection \u00b6 The first thing you will need to send a Redis command is a connection. This package is built on top of DatabaseKit, so you can use any of its convenience methods for creating a new connection. For this example, we will use the withNewConnection(to:) method to create a new connection to Redis. router . get ( \"redis\" ) { req -> Future < String > in return req . withNewConnection ( to : . redis ) { redis in // use redis connection } } See DatabaseKit \u2192 Overview for more information. Available Commands \u00b6 See RedisClient for a list of all available commands. Here we'll take a look at some common commands. Get / Set \u00b6 Redis's GET and SET commands allow you to store and later retrieve data from the server. You can pass any Codable type as the value to this command. router . get ( \"set\" ) { req -> Future < HTTPStatus > in // create a new redis connection return req . withNewConnection ( to : . redis ) { redis in // save a new key/value pair to the cache return redis . set ( \"hello\" , to : \"world\" ) // convert void future to HTTPStatus.ok . transform ( to : . ok ) } } router . get ( \"get\" ) { req -> Future < String > in // create a new redis connection return req . withNewConnection ( to : . redis ) { redis in // fetch the key/value pair from the cache, decoding a String return redis . get ( \"hello\" , as : String . self ) // handle nil case . map { $0 ?? \"\" } } } Delete \u00b6 Redis's DELETE command allows you to clear a previously stored key/value pair. router . get ( \"del\" ) { req -> Future < HTTPStatus > in // create a new redis connection return req . withNewConnection ( to : . redis ) { redis in // fetch the key/value pair from the cache, decoding a String return redis . delete ( \"hello\" ) // convert void future to HTTPStatus.ok . transform ( to : . ok ) } } See RedisClient for a list of all available commands. Keyed Cache \u00b6 You can also use Redis as the backend to Vapor's KeyedCache protocol. router . get ( \"set\" ) { req -> Future < HTTPStatus > in let string = try req . query . get ( String . self , at : \"string\" ) return try req . keyedCache ( for : . redis ). set ( \"string\" , to : string ) . transform ( to : . ok ) } router . get ( \"get\" ) { req -> Future < String > in return try req . keyedCache ( for : . redis ). get ( \"string\" , as : String . self ) . unwrap ( or : Abort (. badRequest , reason : \"No string set yet.\" )) } See DatabaseKit \u2192 Overview for more information.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"redis/overview/#using-redis","text":"Redis ( vapor/redis ) is a pure-Swift, event-driven, non-blocking Redis client built on top of SwiftNIO.

It's most often used for serializing web forms sent via POST requests. This encoding is also used to send structured data in URL query strings. It is a relatively efficient encoding for sending small amounts of data. However, all data must be percent-encoded making this encoding suboptimal for large amounts of data. See the Multipart encoding if you need to upload things like files. Tip URL-Encoded Form integrates with Content like all other encoding methods in Vapor. See Vapor \u2192 Content for more information about the Content protocol. Let's take a look at how to decode a application/x-www-form-urlencoded request. Decode Body \u00b6 Most often, you will be decoding form-urlencoded -encoded requests from a web form. Let's take a look at what one of these requests might look like. After that, we will take a look at what the HTML form for that request would look like. Request \u00b6 Here is an example form-urlencoded -encoded request for creating a new user. POST /users HTTP / 1.1 Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded name=Vapor&age=3&luckyNumbers[]=5&luckyNumbers[]=7 You can see the [] notation is used to encode arrays. Your web form will need to use this notation as well. Form \u00b6 There are many ways to create a form-urlencoded -encoded request, but the most common is an HTML web form. Here is what the HTML form for this request might have looked like. < form method = \"POST\" action = \"/users\" > < input type = \"text\" name = \"name\" > < input type = \"text\" name = \"age\" > < input type = \"text\" name = \"luckyNumbers[]\" > < input type = \"text\" name = \"luckyNumbers[]\" > </ form > Since we are not specifying a special enctype attribute on the <form> , the browser will URL-encode the form by default. We are also providing two fields with the same name, luckyNumbers[] . This will let us send an array of values. Content \u00b6 Now let's take a look at how we would handle this request in Vapor. The first step (as always with Content ) is to create a Codable struct that represents the data structure. import Vapor struct User : Content { var name : String var age : Int var luckyNumbers : [ Int ] } Now that we have our User struct, let's decode that request! We can use the ContentContainer to do this easily. router . post ( \"users\" ) { req -> Future < HTTPStatus > in return try req . content . decode ( User . self ). map ( to : HTTPStatus . self ) { user in print ( user . name ) // \"Vapor\" print ( user . age ) // 3 print ( user . luckyNumbers ) // [5, 7] return . ok } } Now when you post the form to /users , you should see the information printed in the console. Nice work! Encode Body \u00b6 APIs encode form-urlencoded data much less often than they decode it. However, encoding is just as easy with Vapor. Using our same User struct from the previous example, here is how we can encode a form-urlencoded -encoded response. router . get ( \"multipart\" ) { req -> User in let res = req . makeResponse () let user = User ( name : \"Vapor\" , age : 3 , luckyNumbers : [ 5 , 7 ]) res . content . encode ( user , as : . urlEncodedForm ) return user } Tip If you set a default MediaType on your Content types, then you can return them directly in the route closure. URL Query \u00b6 URL-Encoded Forms are also useful for sending structured data in the URL query string. This is widely used for sending data via GET requests where HTTP bodies are not allowed. Let's take a look at how we can decode some search parameters from the query string. GET /users?name=Vapor&age=3 HTTP / 1.1 The first step (as always with Content ) is to create a Codable struct that represents the data structure. import Vapor struct UsersFilters : Content { var name : String ? var age : Int ? } Here we are making both name and age optional since the route can be called without any flags to return all users. Now that we have a Codable struct, we can decode the URL query string. The process is almost identical to decoding content, expect we use req.query instead of req.content . router . get ( \"users\" ) { req -> Future < [ User ] > in let filters = try req . query . decode ( UsersFilters . self ) print ( filters . name ) // Vapor print ( filters . age ) // 3 return // fetch users with filters } Tip Decoding the URL query string is not asynchronous because, unlike HTTP bodies, Vapor can be sure it is available when calling the route closure.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"url-encoded-form/overview/#using-url-encoded-form","text":"URL-Encoded Form is a widely-supported encoding on the web.

It can help validate things like names, emails and more. It is also extensible, allowing you to easily create custom validators. Swift & Codable \u00b6 Swift's strong type system and Codable take care of most of the basic validation that web apps need to do. struct User : Codable { var id : UUID ? var name : String var age : Int var email : String ? var profilePictureURL : String ? } For example, when you decode the above User model, Swift will automatically ensure the following: id is a valid UUID or is nil . name is a valid String and is not nil . age is a valid Int and is not nil . email is a valid String or is nil . profilePictureURL is a valid String or is nil . This is a great first step, but there is still room for improvement here. Here are some examples of things Swift and Codable would not mind, but are not ideal: name is empty string \"\" name contains non-alphanumeric characters age is a negative number -42 email is not correctly formatted test@@vapor.codes profilePictureURL is not a URL without a scheme Luckily the Validation package can help. Validatable \u00b6 Let's take a look at how the Validation package can help you validate incoming data. We'll start by conforming our User model from the previous section to the Validatable protocol. Note This assumes User already conforms to Reflectable (added by default when using one of Fluent's Model protocols). If not, you will need to add conformance to Reflectable manually. extension User : Validatable { /// See `Validatable`. static func validations () -> Validations < User > { // define validations } } let user = User (...) // since User conforms to Validatable, we get a new method validate() // that throws an error if any validations fail try user . validate () This is the basic structure of Validatable conformance. Let's take a look at how we can implement the static validations() method. Validations \u00b6 First let's start by verifying that the name is at least 3 characters long. extension User : Validatable { /// See `Validatable`. static func validations () throws -> Validations < User > { var validations = Validations ( User . self ) try validations . add ( \\ . name , . count ( 3. ..)) return validations } } The count(...) validation accepts Swift Range notation and will validate that a collection's count is within that range. By only placing a value on the left side of ... , we only set a minimum range. Take a look at all of the available validators here . Operators \u00b6 Validating that the name is three or more characters is great, but we also want to make sure that the name is alphanumeric characters only. We can do this by combining multiple validators using && . try validations . add ( \\ . name , . count ( 3. ..) && . alphanumeric ) Now our name will only be considered valid if it is three or more characters and alphanumeric. Take a look at all of the available operators here . Nil \u00b6 You may want to run validations on optionals only if a value is present. The && and || operators have special overloads that help you do this. try validations . add ( \\ . email , . email || . nil ) The nil validator checks if a T? optional value is nil . The email validator checks if a String is a valid email address. However, the property on our User is a String? . This means the email validator cannot be used directly with the property. We can combine these two operators using || to express the validation we want: validate the email is correctly formatted if it is not nil. Validate \u00b6 Let's finish up the rest of our validations using our new knowledge. extension User : Validatable { /// See `Validatable`. static func validations () throws -> Validations < User > { var validations = Validations ( User . self ) try validations . add ( \\ . name , . alphanumeric && . count ( 3. ..)) try validations . add ( \\ . age , . range ( 18. ..)) try validations . add ( \\ . email , . email || . nil ) try validations . add ( \\ . profilePictureURL , . url || . nil ) return validations } } Now let's try out validating our model. router . post ( User . self , at : \"users\" ) { req , user -> User in try user . validate () return user } When you query that route, you should see that errors are thrown if the data does not meet your validations.

All you need to parse and serialize content is a Codable class or struct. For this introduction, we will use mostly JSON as an example. But keep in mind the API is the same for any supported content type. Server \u00b6 This first section will go over decoding and encoding messages sent between your server and connected clients. See the client section for encoding and decoding content in messages sent to external APIs. Request \u00b6 Let's take a look at how you would parse the following HTTP request sent to your server. POST /login HTTP / 1.1 Content-Type : application/json { \"email\" : \"user@vapor.codes\" , \"password\" : \"don't look!\" } First, create a struct or class that represents the data you expect. import Vapor struct LoginRequest : Content { var email : String var password : String } Notice the key names exactly match the keys in the request data. The expected data types also match. Next conform this struct or class to Content . Decode \u00b6 Now we are ready to decode that HTTP request. Every Request has a ContentContainer that we can use to decode content from the message's body. router . post ( \"login\" ) { req -> Future < HTTPStatus > in return req . content . decode ( LoginRequest . self ). map { loginRequest in print ( loginRequest . email ) // user@vapor.codes print ( loginRequest . password ) // don't look! return HTTPStatus . ok } } We use .map(to:) here since decode(...) returns a future . Note Decoding content from requests is asynchronous because HTTP allows bodies to be split into multiple parts using chunked transfer encoding. Router \u00b6 To help make decoding content from incoming requests easier, Vapor offers a few extensions on Router to do this automatically. router . post ( LoginRequest . self , at : \"login\" ) { req , loginRequest in print ( loginRequest . email ) // user@vapor.codes print ( loginRequest . password ) // don't look! return HTTPStatus . ok } Detect Type \u00b6 Since the HTTP request in this example declared JSON as its content type, Vapor knows to use a JSON decoder automatically. This same method would work just as well for the following request. POST /login HTTP / 1.1 Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded email=user@vapor.codes&don't+look! All HTTP requests must include a content type to be valid. Because of this, Vapor will automatically choose an appropriate decoder or error if it encounters an unknown media type. Tip You can configure the default encoders and decoders Vapor uses. Custom \u00b6 You can always override Vapor's default decoder and pass in a custom one if you want. let user = try req . content . decode ( User . self , using : JSONDecoder ()) print ( user ) // Future<User> Response \u00b6 Let's take a look at how you would create the following HTTP response from your server. HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/json { \"name\" : \"Vapor User\" , \"email\" : \"user@vapor.codes\" } Just like decoding, first create a struct or class that represents the data that you are expecting. import Vapor struct User : Content { var name : String var email : String } Then just conform this struct or class to Content . Encode \u00b6 Now we are ready to encode that HTTP response. router . get ( \"user\" ) { req -> User in return User ( name : \"Vapor User\" , email : \"user@vapor.codes\" ) } This will create a default Response with 200 OK status code and minimal headers. You can customize the response using a convenience encode(...) method. router . get ( \"user\" ) { req -> Future < Response > in return User ( name : \"Vapor User\" , email : \"user@vapor.codes\" ) . encode ( status : . created ) } Override Type \u00b6 Content will automatically encode as JSON by default. You can always override which content type is used using the as: parameter. try res . content . encode ( user , as : . urlEncodedForm ) You can also change the default media type for any class or struct. struct User : Content { /// See `Content`. static let defaultContentType : MediaType = . urlEncodedForm ... } Client \u00b6 Encoding content to HTTP requests sent by Client s is similar to encoding HTTP responses returned by your server. Request \u00b6 Let's take a look at how we can encode the following request. POST /login HTTP / 1.1 Host : api.vapor.codes Content-Type : application/json { \"email\" : \"user@vapor.codes\" , \"password\" : \"don't look!\" } Encode \u00b6 First, create a struct or class that represents the data you expect. import Vapor struct LoginRequest : Content { var email : String var password : String } Now we are ready to make our request. Let's assume we are making this request inside of a route closure, so we will use the incoming request as our container. let loginRequest = LoginRequest ( email : \"user@vapor.codes\" , password : \"don't look!\" ) let res = try req . client (). post ( \"https://api.vapor.codes/login\" ) { loginReq in // encode the loginRequest before sending try loginReq . content . encode ( loginRequest ) } print ( res ) // Future<Response> Response \u00b6 Continuing from our example in the encode section, let's see how we would decode content from the client's response. HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/json { \"name\" : \"Vapor User\" , \"email\" : \"user@vapor.codes\" } First of course we must create a struct or class to represent the data. import Vapor struct User : Content { var name : String var email : String } Decode \u00b6 Now we are ready to decode the client response. let res : Future < Response > // from the Client let user = res . flatMap { try $0 . content . decode ( User . self ) } print ( user ) // Future<User> Example \u00b6 Let's now take a look at our complete Client request that both encodes and decodes content. // Create the LoginRequest data let loginRequest = LoginRequest ( email : \"user@vapor.codes\" , password : \"don't look!\" ) // POST /login let user = try req . client (). post ( \"https://api.vapor.codes/login\" ) { loginReq in // Encode Content before Request is sent return try loginReq . content . encode ( loginRequest ) }. flatMap { loginRes in // Decode Content after Response is received return try loginRes . content . decode ( User . self ) } print ( user ) // Future<User> Query String \u00b6 URL-Encoded Form data can be encoded and decoded from an HTTP request's URI query string just like content. All you need is a class or struct that conforms to Content . In these examples, we will be using the following struct. struct Flags : Content { var search : String ? var isAdmin : Bool ? } Decode \u00b6 All Request s have a QueryContainer that you can use to decode the query string. let flags = try req . query . decode ( Flags . self ) print ( flags ) // Flags Encode \u00b6 You can also encode content. This is useful for encoding query strings when using Client . let flags : Flags ... try req . query . encode ( flags ) Dynamic Properties \u00b6 One of the most frequently asked questions regarding Content is: How do I add a property to just this response? The way Vapor 3 handles Content is based entirely on Codable . At no point (that is publically accessible) is your data in an arbitrary data structure like [String: Any] that you can mutate at will. Because of this, all data structures that your app accepts and returns must be statically defined. Let's take a look at a common scenario to better understand this. Very often when you are creating a user, there are a couple different data formats required: create: password should be supplied twice to check values match internal: you should store a hash not the plaintext password public: when listing users, the password hash should not be included To do this, you should create three types. // Data required to create a user struct UserCreate : Content { var email : String var password : String var passwordCheck : String } // Our internal User representation struct User : Model { var id : Int ? var email : String var passwordHash : Data } // Public user representation struct PublicUser : Content { var id : Int var email : String } // Create a router for POST /users router . post ( UserCreate . self , at : \"users\" ) { req , userCreate -> PublicUser in guard userCreate . password == passwordCheck else { /* some error */ } let hasher = try req . make ( /* some hasher */ ) let user = try User ( email : userCreate . email , passwordHash : hasher . hash ( userCreate . password ) ) // save user return try PublicUser ( id : user . requireID (), email : user . email ) } For other methods such as PATCH and PUT , you may want to create additional types to supports the unique semantics. Benefits \u00b6 This method may seem a bit verbose at first when compared to dynamic solutions, but it has a number of key advantages: Statically Typed : Very little validation is needed on top of what Swift and Codable do automatically. Readability : No need for Strings and optional chaining when working with Swift types. Maintainable : Large projects will appreciate having this information separated and clearly stated. Shareable : Types defining what content your routes accept and return can be used to conform to specifications like OpenAPI or even be shared directly with clients written in Swift. Performance : Working with native Swift types is much more performant than mutating [String: Any] dictionaries. JSON \u00b6 JSON is a very popular encoding format for APIs and the way in which dates, data, floats, etc are encoded is non-standard. Because of this, Vapor makes it easy to use custom JSONDecoder s when you interact with other APIs. // Conforms to Encodable let user : User ... // Encode JSON using custom date encoding strategy try req . content . encode ( json : user , using : . custom ( dates : . millisecondsSince1970 )) You can also use this method for decoding. // Decode JSON using custom date encoding strategy let user = try req . content . decode ( json : User . self , using : . custom ( dates : . millisecondsSince1970 )) If you would like to set a custom JSON encoder or decoder globally, you can do so using configuration . Configure \u00b6 Use ContentConfig to register custom encoder/decoders for your application. These custom coders will be used anywhere you do content.encode / content.decode . /// Create default content config var contentConfig = ContentConfig . default () /// Create custom JSON encoder var jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder () jsonEncoder . dateEncodingStrategy = . millisecondsSince1970 /// Register JSON encoder and content config contentConfig . use ( encoder : jsonEncoder , for : . json ) services . register ( contentConfig )","title":"Content"},{"location":"vapor/content/#using-content","text":"In Vapor 3, all content types (JSON, protobuf, URLEncodedForm , Multipart , etc) are treated the same.

Sessions work by creating unique identifiers for each new client and asking the client to supply this identifier with each request. When the next request is received, Vapor uses this unique identifier to restore the session data. This identifier could be transmitted in any format, but it is almost always done with cookies and that is how Vapor's sessions work. When a new client connects and session data is set, Vapor will return a Set-Cookie header. The client is then expected to re-supply the value with each request in a Cookie header. All browsers do this automatically. If your ever decide to invalidate the session, Vapor will delete any related data and notify the client that their cookie is no longer valid. Middleware \u00b6 The first step to using sessions is enabling SessionsMiddleware . This can be done globally for the entire application or on a per-route basis. Globally \u00b6 To globally enable sessions, add the middleware to your MiddlewareConfig . var middlewares = MiddlewareConfig . default () middlewares . use ( SessionsMiddleware . self ) services . register ( middlewares ) This is usually done in configure.swift . Per Route \u00b6 To enable sessions for a group of routes, use the grouped(...) methods on Router . // create a grouped router at /sessions w/ sessions enabled let sessions = router . grouped ( \"sessions\" ). grouped ( SessionsMiddleware . self ) // create a route at GET /sessions/foo sessions . get ( \"foo\" ) { req in // use sessions } Sessions \u00b6 When SessionsMiddleware boots it will attempt to make a Sessions and a SessionsConfig .

You can use Fluent databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc) or caches like Redis to store your sessions. See the respective guides for more information.

This release contains the most changes of any previous release (and most likely any future release). Because of this, it is recommended that to migrate your projects you start by creating a new, empty template and migrate by copy / pasting code over to the new project. We recommend reading the Getting Started \u2192 Hello, world! section for Vapor 3 to familiarize yourself with the new APIs. Async \u00b6 The biggest change in Vapor 3 is that the framework is now completely asynchronous. When you call methods that need to perform slow work like network requests or disk access instead of blocking they will now return a Future<T> . Futures are values that may not exist yet, so you cannot interact with them directly. Instead, you must use map / flatMap to access the values. // vapor 2 let res = try drop . client . get ( \"http://vapor.codes\" ) print ( res . status ) // HTTPStatus return res . status // vapor 3 let f = try req . client (). get ( \"http://vapor.codes\" ). map { res in print ( res . http . status ) // HTTPStatus return res . http . status } print ( f ) // Future<HTTPStatus> See Async \u2192 Getting Started to learn more. Application & Services \u00b6 Droplet has been renamed to Application and is now a service-container. In Vapor 2, the Droplet had stored properties for things you would need during development (like views, hashers, etc). In Vapor 3, this is all done via services. While the Application is a service-container, you should not use it from your route closures. This is to prevent race conditions since Vapor runs on multiple threads (event loops). Instead, use the Request that is supplied to your route closure. This has a copy of all of the application's services for you to use. // vapor 2 return try drop . view . make ( \"myView\" ) // vapor 3 return try req . make ( ViewRenderer . self ). render ( \"myView\" ) // shorthand return try req . view (). render ( \"myView\" ) See Service \u2192 Getting Started to learn more. Database Connections \u00b6 In Vapor 3, database connections are no longer statically accessible. This makes doing things like transactions and connection pooling much more predictable and performant. In order to create a QueryBuilder in Fluent 3, you will need access to something DatabaseConnectable . Most often you can just use the incoming Request , but you can also create connections manually if you need. // vapor 2 User . makeQuery (). all () // vapor 3 User . query ( on : req ). all () See DatabaseKit \u2192 Getting Started to learn more. Migrating SQL Database \u00b6 When migrating from Fluent 2 to 3 you may need to update your fluent table to support the new format. In Fluent 3, the migration log table has the following changes: id is now a UUID . createdAt and updatedAt must now be camelCase . Depending on how your Fluent database was configured, your tables may already be in the correct format. If not, you can run the following queries to transfer the table data. Use this query if your column names were already set to camelCase . ALTER TABLE fluent RENAME TO fluent_old ; CREATE TABLE fluent AS ( SELECT UUID () as id , name , batch , createdAt , updatedAt from fluent_old ); Use this query if your column names were snake_case . ALTER TABLE fluent RENAME TO fluent_old ; CREATE TABLE fluent AS ( SELECT UUID () as id , name , batch , created_at as createdAt , updated_at as updatedAt from fluent_old ); After you have verified the table was transferred properly, you can drop the old fluent table. DROP TABLE fluent_old ; Work in progress \u00b6 This migration guide is a work in progress. Please feel free to add any migration tips here by submitting a PR.

You can send messages (called frames) in either text or binary format. Both the client and the server can send as many messages as they want at a time, without having to wait for responses. Although WebSocket is its own protocol, it still uses HTTP to get setup. Every WebSocket connection will start with an HTTP request with special headers followed by an HTTP response with status 101 Switching Protocols . After this initial handshake, the connection is a WebSocket connection. WebSocket \u00b6 The WebSocket class represents a connected WebSocket client. You can use this to set callbacks for receiving data and to send data. let ws : WebSocket = ... // Send an initial message to this WebSocket ws . send ( \"Hello!\" ) // Set a new callback for receiving text formatted data ws . onText { ws , string in // Echo the text back, reversed. ws . send ( string . reversed ()) } Tip All callbacks will receive a reference to the WebSocket . Use these if you need to send data to avoid creating a reference cycle. The WebSocket has an onClose future that will be completed when the connection closes. You can use close() to close the connection yourself. Server \u00b6 WebSocket servers connect to one or more WebSocket clients at a time. As mentioned previously, WebSocket connections must start via an HTTP request and response handshake. Because of this, WebSocket servers are built on top of HTTP servers using the HTTP upgrade mechanism. // First, create an HTTPProtocolUpgrader let ws = HTTPServer . webSocketUpgrader ( shouldUpgrade : { req in // Returning nil in this closure will reject upgrade if req . url . path == \"/deny\" { return nil } // Return any additional headers you like, or just empty return [:] }, onUpgrade : { ws , req in // This closure will be called with each new WebSocket client ws . send ( \"Connected\" ) ws . onText { ws , string in ws . send ( string . reversed ()) } }) // Next, create your server, adding the WebSocket upgrader let server = try HTTPServer . start ( ... upgraders : [ ws ], ... ). wait () // Run the server. try server . onClose . wait () Seealso Visit HTTP \u2192 Server for more information on setting up an HTTP server. The WebSocket protocol upgrader consists of two callbacks. The first callback shouldUpgrade receives the incoming HTTP request that is requesting upgrade. This callback decides whether or not to complete the upgrade based on the contents of the request. If nil is returned in this closure, the upgrade will be rejected. The second callback onUpgrade is called each time a new WebSocket client connects. This is where you configure your callbacks and send any initial data. Warning The upgrade closures may be called on any event loop. Be careful to avoid race conditions if you must access external variables. Client \u00b6 You can also use the WebSocket package to connect to a WebSocket server. Just like the WebSocket server used an HTTP server, the WebSocket client uses HTTP client. // Create a new WebSocket connected to echo.websocket.org let ws = try HTTPClient . webSocket ( hostname : \"echo.websocket.org\" , on : ...). wait () // Set a new callback for receiving text formatted data. ws . onText { ws , text in print ( \"Server echo: \\( text ) \" ) } // Send a message. ws . send ( \"Hello, world!\" ) // Wait for the Websocket to close. try ws . onClose . wait () Seealso Visit HTTP \u2192 Client for more information on setting up an HTTP client.
