All packages in the [Vapor GitHub](https://github.com/vapor) are maintained according to the following rules.

### Active

While a version is active, reported security issues and bugs are fixed.

Additionally, new features and optimizations may be added. If new API is added, the minor version number will be incremented. At no point can existing API be removed or broken during an active version. Semver is strictly followed and tested.

### Maintenance 

When a new version of Vapor is released, the previous version will enter a maintenance phase which lasts for six months. During this phase, critical security issues and bugs will be fixed. No new features will be added.

!!! note
	Only the latest minor version will be maintained.

### Unstable

The master branch is the latest development version of Vapor and is constantly changing. Before a new version of Vapor is released, there may be unstable alpha and beta phases in which you are welcome to test and provide feedback on the changes.

## Community

All packages in the [Vapor Community GitHub](https://github.com/vapor-community) are maintained in strict accordance of semver. Violations of semver should be reported as issues to the offending package's GitHub page.
