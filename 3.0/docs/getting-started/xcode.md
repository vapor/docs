# Xcode

If you're on a Mac, you can develop your Vapor project using Xcode.
You can build, run, and stop your server from within Xcode, as well as use breakpoints and instruments to debug your code.

Xcode is a great way to develop Vapor apps, but you can use any text editor you like.

## Generate Project

To use Xcode, you just need to generate an Xcode project using [Vapor Toolbox](toolbox.md).

```sh
vapor xcode
```

!!! tip
	Don't worry about comitting the generated Xcode Project to git, just generate a new
	one whenever you need it.

## Run

To build and run your Vapor app, first make sure you have the `Run` scheme selected from the schemes menu.
Also make sure to select "My Mac" as the device.

Once that's selected, just click the play button or press `Command + R` on your keyboard.

## Test

To run your unit tests, select the scheme ending in `-Package` and press `Command + U`.

!!! warning
	There may be a few extraneous schemes in the dropdown menu. Ignore them!
