# Deployment

Deploying code is the process of making your Vapor project publicly available.
It can be one of the most difficult aspects of web development. Fortunately, there
are services to help.

## Vapor Cloud

The best way to deploy your application is through Vapor Cloud. It's a cloud platform built
specifically for the Vapor web framework. This means it's incredibly easy to deploy your
project quickly and be confident that it will be fast and stable.

Deploying your project to Vapor Cloud is simple, it's built right into the [Vapor Toolbox](toolbox.md).
Just run this command from within the root directory of your project.

```sh
vapor cloud deploy
```

## Other Options

Vapor can be deployed anywhere that supports Ubuntu (basically everywhere). To learn more about
deploying your code, check out [Deploy &rarr; Getting Started](../deploy/getting-started.md)
