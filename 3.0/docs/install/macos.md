# Install on macOS

To use Vapor on macOS, you just need to have Xcode 9.3 or greater installed.

## Install Xcode

Install [Xcode 9.3 or greater](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

!!! warning
    After Xcode has been downloaded, you must open it to finish the installation. This may take a while.

### Verify Installation

Double check the installation was successful by opening Terminal and running:

```sh
swift --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```sh
Apple Swift version 4.1.0 (swiftlang-900.0.69.2 clang-900.0.38)
Target: x86_64-apple-macosx10.9
```

!!! warning
    You may need to select Xcode 9.3 in Settings &rarr; Locations &rarr; Command Line Tools.

Vapor requires Swift 4.1 or greater.

## Install Vapor

Now that you have Swift 4.1, let's install the [Vapor Toolbox](../getting-started/toolbox.md).

The toolbox includes all of Vapor's dependencies as well as a handy CLI tool for creating new projects.

```sh
brew install vapor/tap/vapor
```

!!! tip
    If you don't already have Homebrew installed, install it at <a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank">brew.sh &rarr;</a>

### Verify Installation

Double check the installation was successful by opening Terminal and running:

```sh
vapor --help
```

You should see a long list of available commands.

## Done

Now that you have installed Vapor, create your first app in [Getting Started &rarr; Hello, world](../getting-started/hello-world.md).
