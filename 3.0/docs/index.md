# Vapor Documentation

This is the documentation for Vapor, a Web Framework for Swift that works on iOS, macOS, and Ubuntu; and all of the packages that Vapor offers.

Vapor is the most used web framework for Swift. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website or API.

## Getting Started with Vapor

Different people have different backgrounds. Everyone needs a different starting point.

### New to Swift programming?

There are many free and paid books, videos and articles available for established programmers to learn Swift.

[For a quick overview, the official language guide can be found here.](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html).

### First time building for "the web"?

Backend development relies on a different set of prinicples compared to frontend development.

Vapor 3 shares a lot of the same principles with Vapor 2, but a lot has changed. [Catch up with our changes &rarr;](../introductions/vapor2.md)
