# What is Vapor?

Vapor is a [high performance](../supplementary/performance.md), type-safe and [easy to use](setup.md) web framework written in and for Swift.

Vapor is designed for both big and small services, providing a low entry barrier to get started in addition to high performance, well tested and well documented APIs.

### Performance

Vapor's high performance is achieved by a combination of our [asynchronous architecture](../supplementary/architecture.md), Copy on Write mechanics and highly optimized lazy parsers. These three techniques combined with Swift's compiler ensure that our performance is comparable to Go.

### Type safety

Vapor is designed around type-safety and compile-time checks, ensuring that code doesn't behave in unexpected ways and shows you most problems at compile time. Vapor achieves this by leveraging Swift and it's Codable protocol.

We believe type-safety is critical to both security and developer productivity.

### Easy to use

Creating a new Vapor project takes only a few minutes.

We've got you covered with our thorough documentation and have [an amazing community](vapor.team) to back it up!
