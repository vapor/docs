# Contributors

Do you want to help out the framework and other people using it?
 There are many ways to get started, even for non-programmers.

### Writing Documentation

The documentation can always be improved.
Either by adding more documentation or improving the existing documentation.

If you want an easy starting point, help by improving _this exact page_ by lining out ways for other people to help out!

Maybe you found one of our documentation pages lacking the information you needed.
Feel free to contribute ideas and/or text.

### Writing articles

Articles provide a low entry barrier for tackling a subject.
Did you ever come across an issue that you had to solve by yourself?
Share the problem and solution in an article, no matter how long or short!

### Reporting Issues

Feature requests or bug reports are welcome.
Did you find a problem with one of the Vapor libraries? Post an issue to make us aware of it.

### Solving issues

Did you see an issue on GitHub that you can tackle?
Contributing code to OpenSource projects is a great way to learn and build a public portfolio for future employers.

We're happy to help out if you have questions about the framework and it's internals.

### Cleaning up

Code can get messy over time, no matter how well you try to maintain your code.
Cleaning up existing code helps you understand how other programmers think and tackle problems.
It'll help you grow as a developer and help future developers working with that code, too!
