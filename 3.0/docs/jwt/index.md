# JSON Web Token

JSON Web Token is a library containing all JSON Web Token related APIs.

### What is JWT?

JWT is a standard for managing client tokens. Tokens are a form of identification and proof to the server. JWT is cryptographically signed, so it is not possible to falsify the validity of a JWT unless any of the following conditions is met:

- A broken algorithm was used (such as MD5)
- A weak signing key was used and brute-forced
- The signing key used was leaked out to a third party

Please note that any private/secret data **must not** be stored inside a JSON Web Token since they're publically readable. They are **not** encrypted.
