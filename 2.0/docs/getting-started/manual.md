# Manual Quickstart

Learn how to create a Vapor project _without_ the Toolbox using just Swift 3.1 and the Swift Package Manager (SPM).

This document assumes that you have Swift 3.1 installed, if not please refer to [Swift.org](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift) before you can continue.

!!! tip
    If you'd prefer to use the Toolbox, follow the toolbox guide [here](hello-world.md).

## Make new project using SwiftPM

Open your terminal

!!! note
    For our example, we'll be using the Desktop folder.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir Hello
cd Hello
swift package init --type executable
```

Your folder structure should look like this:

```
├── Package.swift
├── Sources
│   └── main.swift
└── Tests
```

### Edit `Package.swift`

Open your `Package.swift` file:

```bash
open Package.swift
```

And add Vapor as a dependency. Here's how your `Package.swift` should look like.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:3.1

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Hello",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/vapor.git", majorVersion: 2)
    ]
)
```

!!! warning
    We try to keep this document up to date, however, you can view latest releases [here](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/releases).

### Edit `main.swift`

A simple hello world:

```swift
import Vapor

let drop = try Droplet()

drop.get("hello") { req in
  return "Hello Vapor"
}

try drop.run()
```

### Compile & Run (Development)

The first `build` command can take a while to fetch dependencies.

```bash
swift build
.build/debug/Hello serve
```

!!! warning
    If different, replace `Hello` above with the name of your executable (as defined in `Package.swift`).

### Production

Compiling in Swift's release mode and setting Vapor's environment to production will make your app more secure and performant.

```sh
swift build --configuration release
.build/release/Hello serve --env=production
```

Go to your favorite browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/hello`
