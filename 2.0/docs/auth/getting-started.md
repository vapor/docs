# Getting Started

Vapor's [Auth Provider](https://github.com/vapor/auth-provider) package makes implementing authentication and 
authorization easy and secure. It supports common auth patterns such as:

- Token (bearer) authentication
- Username + password (basic) authentication
- Permission-based authorization
- Session-based persistance 

Auth's modular, protocol-based nature also makes it a great foundation for custom auth needs.

!!! tip
    Use `vapor new <name> --template=vapor/auth-template` to create a new [project template](https://github.com/vapor/auth-template) with AuthProvider and samples included.

## Package

To use Auth, you will need to have the [Auth Provider](https://github.com/vapor/auth-provider) added to your project.
This is as simple as adding the following line to your `Package.swift` file.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor/auth-provider.git", ...)
```

Check out the [Package](package.md) section for more information.

## Example

Let's take a look at how we can implement a simple, token-based authentication system using Vapor and Auth.


### User

We will start by creating a model to represent our user. If you already have a user class, you can skip this step.

```swift
import Vapor
import FluentProvider

final class ExampleUser: Model {
    let name: String

    ...
}

extension ExampleUser: Preparation { ... }
```

Here we create a very simple user with just one property: a name.

!!! seealso
	We're omitting most of `Model` and `Preparation` protocol requirements. Check out Fluent's 
	[Getting Started](../fluent/getting-started.md) for more information about these protocols.


### Token

Next let's create a model to represent our authentication tokens. These will be stored in a separate database
table or collection called "tokens".

When a user logs in, we will create a new token for them. They will then use this token on subsequent requests
instead of their username and password. 

For now, here's what our simple token model will look like.

```swift
import Vapor
import FluentProvider

final class ExampleToken: Model {
    let token: String
    let userId: Identifier
    
    var user: Parent<ExampleToken, ExampleUser> {
        return parent(id: userId)
    }

    ...
}

extension ExampleToken: Preparation { ... }
```

This token has two properties:

- token: a unique, random string that we will send in requests
- userId: the identifier for the user to whom this token belongs

!!! seealso
	We're using Fluent relations here. Check out Fluent's  [Relations](../fluent/relations.md)
	section for more information.

### Token Authenticatable

Now that we have our example user and token, we can make our user authenticatable with the token.

This might sound complicated, but it's actually pretty easy:

```swift
import AuthProvider

extension ExampleUser: TokenAuthenticatable {
    // the token model that should be queried
    // to authenticate this user
    public typealias TokenType = ExampleToken
}

```

Now that our example user is `TokenAuthenticatable`, we can move on to the next step!

### User Helper

Let's add a simple convenience method on request for accessing the authenticated user.

```swift
extension Request {
    func user() throws -> ExampleUser {
        return try auth.assertAuthenticated()
    }
}
```

This is a nice shortcut that will come in handy in a few steps.

### Middleware

To require authentication we need to add the `TokenAuthenticationMiddleware`. You can apply this middleware
to individual routes or to the entire Droplet. For simplicity, we'll apply it to the Droplet.

```swift
import Vapor
import AuthProvider
import FluentProvider

let config = try Config()

config.preparations.append(ExampleUser.self)
config.preparations.append(ExampleToken.self)

let drop = try Droplet(config)


let tokenMiddleware = TokenAuthenticationMiddleware(ExampleUser.self)

/// use this route group for protected routes
let authed = drop.grouped(tokenMiddleware)
```

Since our `ExampleUser` class is `TokenAuthenticatable`, we can pass it into the middleware's init method.

!!! seealso
	If you only want to require authentication for certain routes, look at our 
	[Route Group](../routing/group.md) section in the routing docs.

### Route

Now that we have a route group protected by our TokenMiddleware, let's add a route to
return the authenticated user's name.

```swift
authed.get("me") { req in
    // return the authenticated user's name
    return try req.user().name
}
```

!!! tip
	We're using the `.user()` convenience we added to `Request` here. It is a shortcut
	for `let user = try req.auth.assertAuthenticated(ExampleUser.self)` 


### Database

That's it! We now have a functioning authentication system. Let's add a couple of entries
to our database and test it out.

#### Users

| id | name |
|----|------|
| 1  | Bob  |

#### Tokens

| id | token | user_id |
|----|-------|---------|
| 1  | foo   | 1       |

### Request

Now we can make a request to our Vapor app.

```http
GET /me HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer foo
```

And we should get a response like.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

Bob
```

#### Bad Token

To make sure it's secure, let's test using a token that's not in our database.

```http
GET /me HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer not-a-token
```

And we should get a response like.

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```

### Next Steps

To build this out into a production-ready authentication system, you will need to build some
additional routes for creating users and creating tokens.
